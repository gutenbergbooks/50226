<h2><i>A COMPOSER&rsquo;S CREED</i></h2>
<p><i>The principal lines which I followed in my creative
work are these:</i></p>
<p><i>The first is classical, whose origin lies in my early
infancy when I heard my mother play Beethoven
sonatas. It assumes a neo-classical aspect in the sonatas
and the concertos, or imitates the classical style of the
eighteenth century, as in the Gavottes, the</i> Classical
Symphony, <i>and, in some respects, in the</i> Sinfonietta.</p>
<p><i>The second is innovation, whose inception I trace
to my meeting with Taneieff, when he taunted me for
my rather &ldquo;elementary harmony.&rdquo; At first, this innovation
consisted in the search for an individual harmonic
language, but later was transformed into a
desire to find a medium for the expression of strong
emotions, as in</i> Sarcasms, Scythian Suite, <i>the opera</i>
The Gambler, They are Seven, <i>the Second Symphony,
etc. This innovating strain has affected not only the
harmonic idiom, but also the melodic inflection, orchestration,
and stage technique.</i></p>
<p><i>The third is the element of the</i> toccata <i>or motor
element, probably influenced by Schumann&rsquo;s Toccata,
which impressed me greatly at one time. In this category
are the Etudes Op. 2, Toccata, Op. 11, Scherzo,
Op. 12, the</i> Scherzo <i>of the Second Piano Concerto,
the Toccata in the Fifth Piano Concerto, the persistent
figurations in the</i> Scythian Suite, Le Pas d&rsquo;acier,
<i>and some passages in the Third Piano Concerto. This
element is probably the least important.</i></p>
<p><i>The fourth element is lyrical. It appears at first as
lyric meditation, sometimes unconnected with melos,
as in</i> Fairy Tale, <i>Op. 3,</i> R&eacute;ves, Esquisse automnale,
<i>Legend, Op. 21, etc., but sometimes is found in long
melodic phrases, as in the opening of the First Violin
Concerto, the songs, etc. This lyric strain has for long
remained in obscurity, or, if it was noticed at all, then
only in retrospection. And since my lyricism has for
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
a long time been denied appreciation, it has grown
but slowly. But at later stages I paid more and more
attention to lyrical expression.</i></p>
<p><i>I should like to limit myself to these four expressions,
and to regard the fifth element, that of the
grotesque, with which some critics are trying to label
me, as merely a variation of the other characteristics.
In application to my music, I should like to replace
the word grotesque by &ldquo;Scherzo-ness,&rdquo; or by the
three words giving its gradations: &ldquo;Jest,&rdquo; &ldquo;laughter,&rdquo;
&ldquo;mockery.&rdquo;</i></p>

<h1 title="">SERGE PROKOFIEFF</h1>
<p class="center"><i>By</i>
<br />LOUIS BIANCOLLI</p>
<p>It is given to few composers to become classics in
their lifetime. Of these few Serge Prokofieff was a
notable example. At his death in Moscow on March
4, 1953, he was a recognized international figure of
long standing, a favorite of concert-goers the world
over, and in almost every musical form, whether
opera, symphony, concerto, suite, or sonata, a securely
established creator. Only two contemporaries could
seriously dispute Prokofieff&rsquo;s dominant position in
world music&mdash;his own countryman Dimitri Shostakovich
and the Finnish Jean Sibelius. There were
those who placed him first. His passing was mourned
inside and outside Russia by all who respond to fastidious
artistry and the strange wizardry of creative
genius. Prokofieff had come to belong to the world.
While his musical and cultural roots were firmly
planted in the land of his birth, he had achieved a
breadth and depth of expression that communicated
to all. In the vast quantity of his output there is something
for everyone everywhere&mdash;for the child, for
the grown-up, for the less musically tutored, and for
the most sophisticated taste. Serge Prokofieff is distinctly
deserving of the word &ldquo;universal.&rdquo; His music
knows no boundaries....</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Serge Prokofieff was born on April 23, 1891, in an
atmosphere of music and culture at Sontsovka in the
south of Russia, where his father managed a large
estate. He seems to have begun composing almost
before he could write his own name, thanks to the
influence and coaching of his mother, an accomplished
pianist. At the age of five he had already put together
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
a little composition called &ldquo;Hindu Galop,&rdquo; and there
is a photograph of the nine-year-old boy seated at
an upright piano with the score of his first opera,
&ldquo;The Giant.&rdquo; Prokofieff himself has given us a picture
of the boy and his mother in their first musical adventures
together:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day when mother was practising exercises by
Hanon, I went up to the piano and asked if I might
play my own music on the two highest octaves of the
keyboard. To my surprise she agreed, in spite of the
resulting cacophony. This lured me to the piano, and
soon I began to climb up to the keyboard all by myself
and try to pick out some little tune. One such tune
I repeated several times, so that mother noticed it
and decided to write it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My efforts at that time consisted of either sitting
at the piano and making up tunes which I could not
write down, or sitting at the table and drawing notes
which could not be played. I just drew them like
designs, as other children draw trains and people,
because I was always seeing notes on the piano stand.
One day I brought one of my papers covered with
notes and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here, I&rsquo;ve composed a Liszt Rhapsody!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was under the impression that a Liszt Rhapsody
was a double name of a composition, like a sonata-fantasia.
Mother had to explain to me that I couldn&rsquo;t
have composed a Liszt Rhapsody because a rhapsody
was a form of musical composition, and Liszt was
the name of the composer who had written it. Furthermore,
I learned that it was wrong to write music on
a staff of nine lines without any divisions, and that it
should be written on a five-line staff with division
into measures. I was greatly impressed by the way
mother wrote down my &lsquo;Hindu Galop&rsquo; and soon, with
her help, I learned something about how to write
music. I couldn&rsquo;t always put my thoughts into notes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
but I actually began to write down little songs which
could be played.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prokofieff also recalled how much his mother
stressed the importance of a love for music and how
she tried to keep it unmarred by excessive practising.
There was only a minimum of that hateful chore,
but a maximum of listening to the great classics of the
keyboard. At first the lessons between mother and
son were limited to twenty minutes a day. This was
extended to one hour when Prokofieff was nine.
&ldquo;Fearing above all the dullness of sitting and drumming
one thing over and over,&rdquo; Prokofieff wrote,
&ldquo;mother hurried to keep me supplied with new pieces
so that the amount of music I studied was enormous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exposure to music continued when the family
moved to Moscow. There Prokofieff attended the
opera repeatedly and soon developed a taste for composing
for voice himself. One of these early efforts was
submitted to the composer Taneieff, who advised the
family to send their son to Reinhold Gliere for further
study. This early attraction for the theatre was
later to culminate not only in several operas of marked
originality but in numerous scores for ballet and the
screen. To the end Prokofieff never quite lost his
childhood passion for the stage. One has only to hear
his music for the &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; ballet and the
opera, &ldquo;The Love of Three Oranges&rdquo; to realize how
enduring a hold the theatre had on him.</p>
<p>Emboldened by Taneieff&rsquo;s reaction, the eleven-year-old
boy next showed him a symphony. Prokofieff
himself told the story to Olin Downes, who interviewed
him in New York in 1919 for the &ldquo;Boston Post.&rdquo;
Taneieff leafed through the manuscript and said:&mdash;&ldquo;Pretty
well, my boy. You are mastering the form
rapidly. Of course, you have to develop more interesting
harmony. Most of this is tonic, dominant and
subdominant [the simplest and most elementary
chords in music], but that will come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Prokofieff to Mr. Downes, &ldquo;distressed
me greatly. I did not wish to do only what others had
done. I could not endure the thought of producing
only what others had produced. And so I started out,
very earnestly, not to imitate, but to find a way of my
own. It was very hard, and my courage was severely
put to the test in the following years, since I destroyed
reams of music, most of which sounded very well,
whenever I realized that it was only an echo of some
one&rsquo;s else. This often wounded me deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven years later I brought a new score to
Taneieff, whom I had not been working with for some
seasons. You should have seen his face when he looked
at the music. &lsquo;But, my dear boy, this is terrible. What
do you call this? And why that?&rsquo; And so forth. Then
I said to him, &lsquo;Master, please remember what you said
to me when I brought my G-major symphony. It was
only tonic, dominant and subdominant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;God in heaven,&rsquo; he shouted, &lsquo;am I responsible for
this?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prokofieff was scarcely thirteen when another distinguished
Russian composer entered his life&mdash;and
again by way of an opera score. Alexander Glazounoff
was so impressed by a work entitled &ldquo;Feast During the
Plague&rdquo; that the boy was promptly enrolled at the
St. Petersburg Conservatory. That was in 1904. There
he remained for ten years, among his teachers being
Liadoff, Tcherepnin, and Rimsky-Korsakoff. From
them he absorbed much of the prodigious skill as
colorist and orchestrator that later went into his compositions,
besides a thorough schooling in the nationalist
ideals of Russian music.</p>
<p>At the same time he was already feeling the urge to
express himself in a bolder and more unorthodox style
of writing. This rebelliousness was later to lead to
controversial clashes over several of his scores. By the
time he left the Conservatory in 1914, Glazounoff
knew that Prokofieff had wandered off into paths of
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
his own. Yet he arranged for a trial performance of
Prokofieff&rsquo;s First Symphony. This proved crucial, for
it attracted the notice of an influential group of vanguard
musicians and, perhaps even more important, a
publisher. Yet, when he graduated, it was not as composer
but as pianist, that Prokofieff carried off first
prize. Shortly after his graduation, Prokofieff&rsquo;s father
died, and when the First World War broke out later
that summer, he was granted exemption from military
service because of his widowed mother.</p>
<p>During the war years Prokofieff composed two
works that would appear to be at opposite extremes of
orchestral style&mdash;the &ldquo;Classical Symphony&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Scythian Suite&rdquo;. One is an unequivocal declaration of
faith in the balanced serenity and suavity of the
Mozartean tradition, and the other rocks with an almost
savage upheaval of barbaric power. Over both,
however, hovers the iron control and superb sureness
of idiom of a searching intellect and an unfailing
artistic insight. The two works represent two parts
rather than two sides of a richly integrated personality.</p>
<p>The revolution of February, 1917, found Prokofieff
in the midst of rehearsals of his opera &ldquo;The Gambler,&rdquo;
founded on Dostoievsky&rsquo;s short novel, to a text of his
own. Production was indefinitely suspended because
of the hardships and uncertainties of the social and
political scene. Actually it was not till 1929 that the
opera was finally produced, in Brussels, Prokofieff
having revised it from the manuscript recovered from
the library of the Maryinsky Theatre of Leningrad.
When the October Revolution had triumphed, Prokofieff
applied for a passport. His intention was to come
to America, where he was assured a lucrative prospect
of creative and concert work. The request was
granted, with this rebuke from a Soviet official:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are revolutionary in art as we are revolutionary
in politics. You ought not to leave us now,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
but then, you wish it. We shall not stop you. Here
is your passport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prokofieff proceeded to make his way to America,
following an itinerary that included Siberia (a small
matter of twenty-six days), Hawaii, San Francisco,
and New York, where he arrived in August, 1918. A
series of recitals followed at which he performed
several of his own compositions, and the Russian
Symphony Orchestra featured some of his larger
works.</p>
<p>A picturesque and revealing reaction to both Prokofieff&rsquo;s
piano-playing and music was that of a member
of the staff of &ldquo;Musical America&rdquo; who was assigned
to review the visitor&rsquo;s first concert at Aeolian Hall on
November 20, 1918.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take one Schoenberg, two Ornsteins, a little
Erik Satie,&rdquo; wrote this culinary expert, &ldquo;mix thoroughly
with some Medtner, a drop of Schumann, a
liberal quantity of Scriabin and Stravinsky&mdash;and you
will brew something like a Serge Prokofieff, composer.
Listen to the keyboard antics of an unholy organism
which is one-third virtuoso, one-third athlete, and one-third
wayward poet, armed with gloved finger-fins
and you will have an idea of the playing of a Serge
Prokofieff, pianist. Repay an impressionist, a neo-fantast,
or whatever you will, in his own coin:&mdash;crashing
Siberias, volcano hell, Krakatoa, sea-bottom
crawlers! Incomprehensible? So is Prokofieff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A commission for an opera from Cleofonte Campanini,
conductor of the Chicago Opera Company,
was to result in what ultimately proved to be his most
popular work composed for America&mdash;the humorous
fairy-tale opera, &ldquo;The Love of Three Oranges.&rdquo; Campanini,
however, had died in the interim, and it was
Mary Garden, newly appointed director (she styled
herself <i>directa</i>!) of the Chicago company, who undertook
the production of the opera in Chicago in
1921. Its reception in Chicago and later at the Manhattan
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Opera House was scarcely encouraging. Almost
three decades were to pass before a spectacularly successful
production, in English, by Laszlo Halasz at
the New York City Center gave it a secure and enduring
place in the active American repertory.</p>
<p>Prokofieff next went to Paris, where he renewed
ties with a group of Russian musicians and intellectuals,
among them the two Serges who were to become
so helpful in the development of his reputation as a
dominant force in modern music. These were Serge
Diaghileff and Serge Koussevitzky. For Diaghileff he
wrote music for a succession of ballets, among them
&ldquo;Chout&rdquo; (1921), &ldquo;Pas d&rsquo;Acier&rdquo; (1927), and &ldquo;The
Prodigal Son&rdquo; (1929). Considerable interest was
aroused by &ldquo;Pas d&rsquo;Acier&rdquo;, which was termed both a
&ldquo;labor ballet&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Bolshevik Ballet&rdquo; by various
members of the press both in Paris and in London,
where the work was given in July, 1927. It was a ballet
of factories and firemen, of lathes and drill-presses, of
wheels and workers, and it brought Prokofieff the
dubious title of composer laureate of the mechanistic
age.</p>
<p>Koussevitzky had begun his celebrated series of concerts
in Paris in 1921. This proved a perfect setting
for the newcomer. Again and again the programs
afforded him a double hospitality as composer and
pianist. Koussevitzky introduced the Second Symphony
and when he later took up the baton of the
Boston Symphony, Prokofieff was among the first
composers invited to appear on his programs in either
or both capacities. In 1929, on the fiftieth anniversary
of the Boston Symphony, it was to Serge Prokofieff
that Koussevitzky went for a symphonic score to commemorate
the occasion. The resulting work was Prokofieff&rsquo;s
Fourth Symphony. It was not till 1927 that
Prokofieff, absent from his homeland for nine years,
decided to return, if only for a visit. Of this period
away from home, Nicolas Nabokov, who knew Prokofieff
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
well, had this to say in an article written for
&ldquo;The Atlantic Monthly&rdquo; in July, 1942:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From 1922 until 1926 Prokofieff lived in France
and travelled only for his annual concert tours. In
Paris he found himself surrounded by a seething international
artistic life in which the Russian element
played a great part, thanks mainly to Diaghileff and
his Ballet. Most of these people were expatriates, in
various degrees opposed to the new regime in their
motherland. Prokofieff had too close and too profound
a relation with Russia to lose himself in this atmosphere.
He kept up his friendships with those who
stayed in Russia and those who were abroad by simply
putting himself, in a certain sense, outside of the
whole problem. It was interesting to watch how cleverly
he succeeded in this position. There was nothing
strained or unnatural about it. He earned the esteem
of both camps and the confidence of everyone. From
a production by the Ballet Russe of his latest ballet,
Prokofieff would go to the Soviet Embassy, where a
party would be given in his honor, and at his home
you would find the intellectuals arriving from Russia,
among them his great friend, Meyerhold, Soviet writers,
and poets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1927 he dug out his old Soviet passport and
returned for a short while to Russia. As a result of
this first trip came his ballet &lsquo;Pas d&rsquo;Acier&rsquo;. This was
Prokofieff&rsquo;s greatest success in Paris. It coincided with
a turn in French public opinion toward Russia, with
the beginning of the Five-Year Plan, and the increasing
interest in Russian affairs among the intelligentsia
of Western Europe. For several years to come Prokofieff
kept up the dual life of going to Russia for several
months and spending the rest of the time in Paris,
until finally the demands of his country inwardly and
outwardly became so strong that he decided definitely
to return and settle in Moscow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prokofieff had again visited America in 1933. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
New York, within the space of a few days, he performed
his Fifth Concerto with Koussevitzky and the
Boston Symphony, and his Third Concerto with Bruno
Walter and the Philharmonic-Symphony. So many
references have been made in these pages to Prokofieff
as his own soloist, that perhaps a few balanced words
from Philip Hale on the subject may be appropriate
at this point. After having heard him several times in
Boston, the late critic and annotator, declared:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His pianistic gifts are unusually great; there was
reason for his being recognized in America primarily
as a pianist and only later on as a composer. Though
possessed of all these exceptional attainments, Prokofieff
uses them within the rigid limits of artistic simplicity,
which precludes the possibility of any affectation,
any calculating of effect whereby an elevated
style of pianism is sullied. In any case I have never
heard a pianist who plays Prokofieff&rsquo;s productions
more simply and at the same time more powerfully
than the composer himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prokofieff&rsquo;s return to Russia opened a new and
active chapter of his career. Almost overnight he began
to identify himself with the ideals of Soviet musical
organizations insofar as they were concerned with
education and the fostering of a community feeling of
cultural solidarity. The attraction of the theatre was
stronger than ever, and soon he was composing operas,
ballet scores, incidental music for plays, and music for
films. Indeed, the composition that virtually reintroduced
him to the Russian public was the striking score
for the film &ldquo;Lieutenant Kije.&rdquo; This delighted one and
all with its pungent wit and satiric thrusts at the parading
pomp and stiffness of the court of Czar Paul. Less
successful was the first performance in Moscow in
1934 of a &ldquo;Chant Symphonique&rdquo; for large orchestra.
This drew the reproach that it echoed &ldquo;the disillusioned
mood and weary art of the urban lyricists of
contemporary Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Another composition of this period was a suite prepared
by Prokofieff from a ballet entitled, &ldquo;Sur le
Borysth&egrave;ne.&rdquo; Interest attaches to this ballet because of
a significant verdict pronounced by a Paris judge in
Prokofieff&rsquo;s favor. The ballet had been commissioned
by Serge Lifar and produced at the Paris Op&eacute;ra in
1933. The contract had stipulated one hundred
thousand francs as payment for the work. Only seventy
thousand francs were paid, and Prokofieff sued for
the remainder. Lifar contended in court that the unfriendly
reception accorded the production proved
the ballet was &ldquo;deficient in artistic merit.&rdquo; The court&rsquo;s
judgment, rendered on January 9, 1934, read in part:
&ldquo;Any person acquiring a musical work puts faith in
the composer&rsquo;s talent. There is no reliable criterion
for evaluation of the quality of a work of art which
is received according to individual taste. History
teaches us that the public is often mistaken in its
reaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prokofieff made his last trip to the United States in
February, 1938. In several interviews with the press
he laid particular stress on how Russia provided &ldquo;a
livelihood and leisure&rdquo; for composers and musicians
of all categories. Later, the League of Composers invited
him to be guest of honor at a concert devoted
entirely to his music. Prokofieff was to have made still
another visit to America late in 1940 on the invitation
of the New York Philharmonic-Symphony Society.
The invitation was accepted, but Prokofieff never
came. The reason given was that he could not secure
the required visas. Prokofieff was to have conducted
a series of concerts with the Philharmonic-Symphony.
The Society accordingly asked another distinguished
Russian composer to direct the concerts, a Russian
who had not set foot in his native land since the
Revolution&mdash;Igor Stravinsky.</p>
<p>Prokofieff was again at work on an opera&mdash;&ldquo;The
Duenna&rdquo;&mdash;when his country once more found itself
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
at war with Germany. Both the opera and a new ballet,
&ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo;, were immediately shelved, and Prokofieff
dedicated his energies and talents to expressing in
music the determination of the Soviet people to resist
the Nazi invasion and join in the world struggle to
crush Fascism. Instead of light operas and fairy-tale
ballets, he now composed a march, two war songs,
and a symphonic suite &ldquo;1941,&rdquo; a title which explains
itself. As the war dragged on with its deadening weight
of horror, and its unprecedented drama of resistance,
the feelings it gave rise to inspired Prokofieff to compose
an opera based on Tolstoy&rsquo;s monumental historical
novel, &ldquo;War and Peace.&rdquo; America learned of
its completion on January 1, 1943 in a communication
that conveyed New Year&rsquo;s greetings &ldquo;to our
American friends on behalf of all Soviet composers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opera caused Prokofieff considerable trouble
because of its unparalleled length. Cuts and revisions
were made, scenes transposed and replaced, and yet
Prokofieff was never quite satisfied with the work.
Excerpts were performed in Moscow, and again the
music of Prokofieff became a bone of lively contention
between those who thought he had captured the
spirit of the novel and those who thought he had not.
There was general agreement, however, that Prokofieff
had written a magnificent and stirring tribute to
Russian valor and patriotism. Together with his music
for the films &ldquo;Ivan the Terrible&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alexander
Nevsky&rdquo;, the new opera offered an impressive panorama
of Russian history. There are in &ldquo;War and
Peace&rdquo; eleven long scenes and sixty characters. The
work was much too long for a single evening, and
when it was finally produced in Moscow in 1946,
only the first part was performed. A stage premiere
had been promised in Moscow as early as 1943, but
technical difficulties caused its postponement. Plans
for a Metropolitan production for the season of
1944-45 also had to be abandoned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>In 1945 Prokofieff composed his Fifth Symphony,
which is considered by many critics the greatest single
achievement of his symphonic career. Prokofieff has
himself spoken of it as &ldquo;the culmination of a large
part of my creative life.&rdquo; The symphony was warmly
received both in Russia and in America. It has generally
been assumed that it depicts both the tragic
and heroic phases of the world crisis and an unshaken
confidence in final victory over Nazi barbarism.
Prokofieff himself would provide no clue to its program
other than that it was &ldquo;a symphony about the
spirit of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Germany was at last defeated, Prokofieff&rsquo;s
pen was again busy celebrating the event. This time
it was an &ldquo;Ode to the End of the War&rdquo;, scored for
sixteen double basses, eight harps and four pianos. In
1947 Prokofieff composed his Sixth Symphony, and
it was shortly after its first performance that the
Central Committee of the Communist Party issued
its stinging denunciation of certain tendencies in the
music of Prokofieff and six other Soviet composers.
The occasion of the official rebuke was a new opera
by Vano Muradeli, &ldquo;Great Friendship.&rdquo; This work
was found offensive as a distortion of history and a
false and imperfect exploitation of national material.
Having disposed of Muradeli, the Committee concentrated
its attack on the Symphonic Six&mdash;Shostakovich,
Prokofieff, Khatchaturian, Shebalin, Popoff,
and Miaskovsky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are speaking of composers,&rdquo; read the statement,
&ldquo;who confine themselves to the formalist anti-public
trend. This trend has found its fullest manifestation
in the works of such composers [naming
the six] in whose compositions the formalist distortions,
the anti-democratic tendencies in music, alien
to the Soviet people and to its artistic taste, are especially
graphically represented. Characteristics of such
music are the negation of the basic principles of
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
classical music; a sermon for atonality, dissonance
and disharmony, as if this were an expression of
&lsquo;progress&rsquo; and &lsquo;innovation&rsquo; in the growth of musical
composition as melody; a passion for confused, neuropathic
combinations which transform music into
cacophony, into a chaotic piling up of sounds. This
music reeks strongly of the spirit of the contemporary
modernist bourgeois music of Europe and America,
which reflects the marasmus of bourgeois culture, the
full denial of musical art, its impasse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like the other six composers, Prokofieff accepted
the rebuke and made public acknowledgment that
he had pursued paths of sterile experimentation in
some of his more recent music. He declared that the
Resolution of the Central Committee had &ldquo;separated
decayed tissue from healthy tissue in the composers&rsquo;
creative production,&rdquo; and that it had created the prerequisites
&ldquo;for the return to health of the entire
organism of Soviet music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prokofieff&rsquo;s <i>mea culpa</i> was first contained in a letter
addressed to Tikhon Khrennikoff, general secretary
of the Union of Soviet composers. It had been
Khrennikoff, who, in a semi-official blast at these
&ldquo;tendencies&rdquo; had first hurled the charge of &ldquo;formalism&rdquo;
at Prokofieff and his colleagues, Khrennikoff evidently
had in mind certain patterns and formulas of
the more extreme innovations of modern music, like
Arnold Schoenberg&rsquo;s twelve-tone row and the many
flourishing European schools of atonality, dissonance,
and startling instrumental groupings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Composers have become infatuated,&rdquo; said Khrennikoff,
&ldquo;with formalistic innovations, artificially inflated
and impracticable orchestral combinations, such
as the including of twenty-four trumpets in Khatchaturian&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Symphonic Poem&rsquo; or the incredible scoring
for sixteen double-basses, eight harps, four pianos,
and the exclusion of the rest of the string instruments
in Prokofieff&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ode on the End of War.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>In pleading guilty to the charge of formalism,
Prokofieff attempted to explain how it had found its
way into his music:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The resolution is all the more important because
it has demonstrated that the formalist trend is alien
to the Soviet people, that it leads to the impoverishment
and decline of music, and has pointed out with
definitive clarity the aims which we must strive to
achieve as the best way to serve the Soviet people.
<i>Speaking of myself, the elements of formalism were
peculiar to my music as long as fifteen or twenty years
ago. The infection was caught apparently from contact
with a number of Western trends.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spectacle of one of the world&rsquo;s most cherished
and gifted composers making apologetic obeisance to
political officialdom was hardly a comfortable one
for observers outside Russia. The non-Communist
press pounced righteously on the Central Committee&rsquo;s
resolution as an arbitrary invasion of the sacred
province of art. Charges of irresponsible government
interference with the free workings of creative endeavor
were widely made, and even writers who had
been at least culturally sympathetic to the accomplishments
of Soviet art and education waxed indignant
over the episode. Many wondered why Prokofieff,
of advanced musical craftsmen of our time perhaps
the most classical and even the most melodious, should
have been singled out at all. This bewilderment was
perhaps best expressed by Robert Sabin, of the
&ldquo;Musical America&rdquo; staff:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His music is predominantly melodious, harmonically
and contrapuntally clear, formally organic without
being pedantic, original but unforced&mdash;in short
an expression of the basic principles of classical music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the phrases in the Central Committee&rsquo;s
denunciation are fantastically inappropriate to Prokofieff&rsquo;s
art. Prokofieff has never espoused atonality.
He is eminently a democratic composer. Peter and
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
the Wolf is loved by children and unspoiled adults
the world over. His music for the film Alexander
Nevsky and the cantata he later fashioned from it
have been enormously popular. His suite Lieutenant
Kij&eacute;, originally composed for another motion picture,
charmed audiences as soon as it was heard, in 1934.
On the contrary, among contemporary masters
Prokofieff is precisely one whom we can salute as
being close to the people, able to write music that
is equally appealing to connoisseurs and less demanding
listeners, a man who understands the musical
character of simple human beings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the outstanding psychological trait of
Prokofieff&rsquo;s music has been its splendid healthiness.
His Classical Symphony of 1916-17 bounds along
with exhilarating energy and spontaneity; and in his
works of the last decade, 1941-51, such as the ballet,
&lsquo;Cinderella&rsquo;, the String Quartet No. 2, and the Symphony
No. 5, we find the same fullness of creative
power, the same acceptance of life and ability to
find it good and wholesome. Prokofieff belongs to the
company of Bach and Handel in this respect&mdash;not
to that of Scriabin and other composers whose genius
had been tinged with neurotic traits and a tendency
to cultism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing deterred by this unprecedented official
spanking, Prokofieff went about his business, which
was composing. The demands and necessities of this
post-war period of reconstruction in Soviet life drew
him deeper and deeper into the orbit of its community
culture. A large proportion of his music became
markedly topical and &ldquo;national&rdquo; in theme and orientation.
Yet for all the strictures levelled at his music,
and Khrennikoff was to scold him yet once more for
&ldquo;bourgeois formalism&rdquo;, Prokofieff, in most essentials,
followed the unhampered bent of his genius. Ballet
music, piano and cello sonatas continued to show
that preoccupation with living and exciting form that
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
in the best art can be dictated only by the exigencies
of the material. It is possible that towards the very
end Prokofieff had found a new synthesis that brought
to full flower the abiding lyricism of his nature. That
he was now determined to achieve an emotional communication
through a lyrical simplicity of idiom about
which there could be no mystery or confusion is clear.
How much of this was owing to any official effort to
discipline him and how much to the inevitable direction
of his own creative logic it must remain for later
and better informed students to assess.</p>
<p>The Seventh Symphony would seem to be a final
testament of Prokofieff&rsquo;s return to this serene transparency
of style. The new symphony was proof conclusive
to the editors of &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo; that Prokofieff
&ldquo;had taken to heart the criticism directed at his work
and succeeded in overcoming the fatal influence of
formalism.&rdquo; Prokofieff was now seeking &ldquo;to create
beautiful, delicate music able to satisfy the artistic
tastes of the Soviet people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prokofieff&rsquo;s death on March 4, 1953, the announcement
of which was delayed several days perhaps because
of the overshadowing illness and death of
Premier Stalin, came with the shock of an irreparable
loss to music-lovers everywhere. A chapter of world
music in which a strong and fastidious classical sense
had combined with a healthy and sometimes startling
freshness of novelty, seemed to have closed. Dead at
sixty-two, Serge Prokofieff had now begun that second
life in the living memorial of the permanent repertory
that is both the reward and the legacy of creative
genius. It is safe to predict that so long as the concert
hall endures as an institution, a considerable portion
of his music will have a secure place within its
hospitable walls.</p>

<h2 id="c1">THE MUSIC</h2>
<h2 id="c2">SYMPHONIES</h2>
<h3 class="generic">&ldquo;<i>Classical Symphony in D major, Opus 25</i>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;If we wished to establish Prokofieff&rsquo;s genealogy
as a composer, we would probably have to betake
ourselves to the eighteenth century, to Scarlatti and
other composers of the good old times, who have
inner simplicity and naivete of creative art in common
with him. Prokofieff is a classicist, not a romantic,
and his appearance must be considered a belated
relapse of classicism in Russia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So wrote Leonid Sabaneyeff, and it was the
&ldquo;Classical Symphony&rdquo; more than any other composition
of Prokofieff that inspired his words, as it has
the pronouncements of others who have used this
early symphony as an index of the composer&rsquo;s predilections.
Yet it is dangerous to so classify Prokofieff,
except insofar as he remained loyal to a discipline of
compression and a tradition of craftsmanship that
seemed the very antithesis of the romantic approach
to music. Nor was Prokofieff interested in imitating
Mozart or Haydn in his &ldquo;Classical Symphony.&rdquo; Whatever
has been written about his implied or assumed
intentions, he made his aim quite explicit. What he
set out to do was to compose the sort of symphony
that Mozart might have written had Mozart been
a contemporary of Prokofieff&rsquo;s; not, it is clear, the
other way around&mdash;that is, to compose the sort of
symphony he might have written had he, instead,
been a contemporary of Mozart&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The symphony was begun in 1916, finished the
following year, and first performed in Leningrad on
April 21, 1918. Prokofieff conducted the work himself
when he appeared in Carnegie Hall, New York, at
a concert of the Russian Symphony Society on December
11, 1918. The occasion was its American premiere,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
and the &ldquo;Classical Symphony&rdquo; speedily became a
favorite of the concert-going public. And no wonder!
It is music that commends itself at once through a
limpid style, an endearing precision of stroke, an
unfailing wit of melody, and a general salon-like
atmosphere of courtly gallantry.</p>
<p>I. <i>Allegro, D major, 2/2.</i> The first violins give out
the sprightly first theme, the flutes following with a
subsidiary theme in a passage that leads to a development
section. The first violins now chant a second
theme, friskier than the first in its wide leaps and
mimicked by a supporting bassoon. Both major themes
supply material for the main development section.
There is a general review in C major, leading to the
return of the second theme in D major, the key of
the movement.</p>
<p>II. <i>Larghetto, A major, 3/4.</i> The chief melody of
this movement is again entrusted to the first violins
after a brief preface of four measures. &ldquo;Only a certain
rigidity in the harmonic changes and a slight exaggeration
in the melodic line betray a non-&lsquo;classical&rsquo;
feeling,&rdquo; wrote one annotator. &ldquo;The middle section is
built on a running pizzicato passage. After rising to
a climax, the interest shifts to the woodwinds, and
a surprise modulation brings back the first subject,
which, after a slight interruption by a recall of the
middle section, picks up an oboe counterpoint in
triplets. At the end the accompaniment keeps marching
on until it disappears in the distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III. <i>Gavotte: Non troppo allegro, D major, 4/4.</i>
This replaces the usual minuet in the classical scheme
of things. One senses a scherzo without glimpsing its
shape. The strings and the woodwinds announce the
graceful dance theme in the first part, which is only
twelve measures long in a symphony which lasts, in
all, as many minutes. In the G major Trio that follows,
flutes and clarinets join in sustaining a theme over a
pastoral-like organ-point in the cellos and double-basses.
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
A counter-theme is heard in the oboe. The first
part returns, and the movement is over in a flash.</p>
<p>The Gavotte was a widely used dance form in the
music of the eighteenth century. It was said to stem
from the Gavots, the people of the Pays de Gap.
Originally a &ldquo;danse grave&rdquo;, it differed from others of
its kind in one respect. The dancers neither walked
nor shuffled, but raised their feet. The gavotte was
supposedly introduced to the French court in the
sixteenth century as part of the entertainment enacted
by natives in provincial costumes.</p>
<p>IV. <i>Finale: Molto vivace, D major, 2/2.</i> A bright
little theme, chattered by the strings after an emphatic
chord, serves as principal subject of this movement.
A bridge-passage leads to a two-part second subject,
in A major, the first part taken up by the woodwinds
in a twittering melody (later passed to the strings),
the second a counter-theme for solo oboe. The material
is briefly and lucidly developed, and a recapitulation
brings back the first section, with the woodwinds
assuming the theme over a web of string pizzicati.
A miniature coda follows, and there is a sudden halt
to the music, as if at the precise, split-second moment
that its logic and breath have run out.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><i>Symphony No. 5, Op. 100</i></h3>
<p>Of Prokofieff&rsquo;s subsequent symphonies it is only
the Fifth thus far that has established itself with any
promise of endurance in the concert repertory. The
First, composed in 1908 and not included in the
catalogue of Prokofieff&rsquo;s works, may be dismissed as
a student experiment. The Second, following sixteen
years later, proved a stylistic misfit of noisy primitivism
and even noisier factory-like mechanism. The
Third, an impassioned and dramatic fantasy, dating
from 1928, drew on material from an unproduced
opera, &ldquo;The Flaming Angel.&rdquo; Prokofieff also tells us
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
that the stormy scherzo movement derived in part
from Chopin&rsquo;s B-flat minor Sonata. The symphony
was first performed in Paris on May 17, 1929, and
carries a dedication to his life-long friend and colleague,
the composer Miaskovsky. &ldquo;I feel that in this
symphony I have succeeded in deepening my musical
language,&rdquo; Prokofieff wrote after his return to Russia
and when the work had received its initial performances
there. &ldquo;I should not want the Soviet listener to
judge me solely by the March from &lsquo;The Love of
Three Oranges&rsquo; and the Gavotte from the &lsquo;Classical
Symphony.&rsquo;&rdquo; According to Israel Nestyev, Prokofieff&rsquo;s
Soviet biographer, the Third Symphony was
&ldquo;something of an echo of the past, being made up
chiefly of materials relating to 1918 and 1919.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the Fourth Symphony we come to what might
be termed Prokofieff&rsquo;s &ldquo;American&rdquo; Symphony. This
was composed in 1929 for the Fiftieth Anniversary
of the Boston Symphony. Much of the music harks
back to the suave and courtly style of the &ldquo;Classical&rdquo;
Symphony, without its uniform elegance of idiom,
however. It was certainly a change from an explosion
like the &ldquo;Scythian&rdquo; Suite, that had fairly rocked the
sedate and cultivated subscribers of Symphony Hall
out of their seats.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>It is the Fifth that constitutes Prokofieff&rsquo;s most
ambitious contribution to symphonic literature. It is
a complex and infinitely variegated score, yet its
composition took a solitary month. Another month
was given over to orchestrating the work, and somewhere
in between Prokofieff managed to begin and
complete one of his most enduring film scores, that
to Eisenstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ivan the Terrible.&rdquo; The fact is that
Prokofieff had been jotting down themes for this
symphony in a special notebook for several years.
&ldquo;I always work that way,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and that
is probably why I write so fast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Composed during the summer of 1944, the Fifth
Symphony was performed in America on November
9, 1945, at a concert of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra under the direction of Serge Koussevitzky.
Five days later, under the same auspices, it was
introduced to New York at Carnegie Hall. Prokofieff
had himself directed the world premiere in Moscow
in January of that year. At that time Prokofieff, asked
about the program or content of the symphony would
only admit that it was a symphony &ldquo;about the spirit
of man.&rdquo; The symphony was composed and performed
in Moscow at a time of mounting Soviet victories
over the German invaders. It seemed inevitable that
a mood of exultation would find its way into this
music. To Nestyev the symphony captured the listeners
&ldquo;with its healthy mood of affirmation.&rdquo; Continuing,
this Soviet analyst declared that &ldquo;in the
heroic, manly images of the first movement, in the
holiday jubilation of the finale, the listeners sensed
a living transmutation of that popular emotional
surge ... which we felt in those days of victories
over Nazi Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In four movements, the Fifth Symphony is of basic
traditional structure, despite its daring lapses from
orthodoxy. The predominant mood is heroic and
affirmative, at times tragic in its fervid intensity,
sombre recurringly, but essentially an assertion of
joyous strength, with momentary bursts of sidelong
gaiety reserved for the last movement. A terse and
searching analysis of the Fifth Symphony was made
by John N. Burk for the program-book of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra. It reads:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I. <i>Andante.</i> The opening movement is built on
two full-voiced melodic themes, the first in triple, the
second in duple beat. Contrast is found in the alternate
rhythm as both are fully developed. There is an
impressive coda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;II. <i>Allegro marcato.</i> The second movement has
earmarks of the classical scherzo. Under the theme
there is a steady reiteration of a staccato accompaniment,
4/4. The melody, passed by the clarinet to the
other woodwinds and by them variously treated, plays
over the marked and unremitting beat. A bridge
passage for a substantial wind choir ushers in (and
is to usher out) the Trio-like middle section, which
is in 3/4 time and also rhythmically accented, the
clarinet first bearing the burden of the melody. The
first section, returning, is freshly treated. At the close
the rhythm becomes more incisive and intense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;III. <i>Adagio. 3/4.</i> The slow movement has, like
the scherzo, a persistent accompaniment figure. It
opens with a melody set forth <i>espressivo</i> by the woodwinds,
carried by the strings into their high register.
The movement is tragic in mood, rich in episodic
melody. It carries the symphony to its deepest point
of tragic tension, as descending scales give a weird
effect of outcries. But this tension suddenly passes,
and the reprise is serene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;IV. <i>Allegro giocoso.</i> The finale opens <i>Allegro
giocoso</i>, and after a brief tranquil passage for the
divided cellos and basses, gives its light, rondo-like
theme. There is a quasi-gaiety in the development,
but, as throughout the symphony, something ominous
seems always to lurk around the corner. The awareness
of brutal warfare broods over it and comes forth
in sharp dissonance&mdash;at the end.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="generic"><i>The Sixth Symphony, in E-flat minor, Opus 111</i></h3>
<p>In a letter to his American publishers dated September
6, 1946, Prokofieff announced that he was
working on two major compositions&mdash;a sonata for
violin and piano and a Sixth Symphony. &ldquo;The symphony
will be in three movements,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Two
of them were sketched last summer and at present
I am working on the third. I am planning to orchestrate
the whole symphony in the autumn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The various emotional states or moods of the
symphony Prokofieff described as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The first
movement is agitated in character, lyrical in places,
and austere in others. The second movement, <i>andante</i>,
is lighter and more songful. The finale, lighter and
major in its character, would be like the finale of my
Fifth Symphony but for the austere reminiscences
of the first movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How active and productive a worker Prokofieff was
may be gathered from other disclosures in the same
letter. Besides the Symphony and Sonata, he was
applying the finishing touches to a &ldquo;Symphonic Suite
of Waltzes,&rdquo; drawn from his ballet, &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo;,
his opera, &ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo; (based on Tolstoy&rsquo;s historical
novel), and his score for the film biography
of the Russian poet Lermontov. Earlier that summer
he had completed three separate suites from &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;big new scene&rdquo; for &ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo;.
No idler he!</p>
<p>The first performance of Prokofieff&rsquo;s Sixth Symphony
occurred in Moscow on October 10, 1947. Four
months later, on February 11, 1948, the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
issued its resolution denouncing Prokofieff and six
other Soviet composers for their failure to &ldquo;permeate
themselves with a consciousness of the high demands
made of musical creation by the Soviet people.&rdquo; The
seven composers were charged with &ldquo;formalist distortions
and anti-democratic tendencies in music&rdquo; in
several of their more recent symphonic and operatic
works. It has been assumed that the Sixth Symphony
was among the offending scores which the Central
Committee had in mind. While it was not placed
under the official ban, it did not figure subsequently
in the active repertory. To Leopold Stokowski, who
conducted its American premiere with the New York
Philharmonic on November 24, 1949, in Carnegie
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
Hall, we owe the perceptive analysis of the Sixth
Symphony that follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>I. &ldquo;The first part has two themes&mdash;the first in a
rather fast dance rhythm, the second a slower songlike
melody, a little modal in character, recalling the
old Russian and Byzantine scales. Later this music
becomes gradually more animated as the themes are
developed, and after a climax of the development
there is a slower transition to the second part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II. &ldquo;I think this second part will need several hearings
to be fully understood. The harmonies and texture
of the music are extremely complex. Later there
is a theme for horns which is simpler and sounds like
voices singing. This leads to a warm <i>cantilena</i> of the
violins and a slower transition to the third part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III. &ldquo;This is rhythmic and full of humor, verging
on the satirical. The rhythms are clear-cut, and while
the thematic lines are simple, they are accompanied
by most original harmonic sequences, alert and rapid.
Near the end a remembrance sounds like an echo of
the pensive melancholy of the first part of the symphony,
followed by a rushing, tumultuous end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stokowski has also stated that the Sixth Symphony
represents a natural development of Prokofieff&rsquo;s
extraordinary gifts as an original creative artist. &ldquo;I
knew Prokofieff well in Paris and in Russia,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;and I feel that this symphony is an eloquent
expression of the full range of his personality. It is
the creation of a master artist, serene in the use and
control of his medium.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="generic"><i>The Seventh Symphony, Opus 131</i></h3>
<p>At this writing the Seventh Symphony has yet to
be heard in New York. Its American premiere by
the Philadelphia Orchestra has been announced for
April 10, to be followed by its first performance in
Carnegie Hall, by the same orchestra, on April 21,
with Eugene Ormandy to conduct on both occasions.
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
The work was composed in 1952 and performed for
the first time in Moscow on October 11, 1952, under
the direction of Samuel Samosud. It is a comparatively
short symphony as the symphonies of our time
go, lasting no more than thirty minutes. For Prokofieff
the orchestration is relatively modest and the division
of the symphony is in the four traditional movements:&mdash;</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>I. Moderato</dt>
<dt>II. Allegretto</dt>
<dt>III. Andante espressivo</dt>
<dt>IV. Vivace</dt></dl>
<p>From first note to last it is a transparent score, lyrical,
melodic, and easily grasped and assimilated. Recurring
themes are readily identified. &ldquo;The harmonic
structure could hardly be called modern in this <i>anno
domini</i> 1953,&rdquo; writes Donald Engle, &ldquo;and the scoring
is generally open and concise, at times even spare
and lean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The overall impression is that the music has two
inevitable points of being, its beginning and its end,
and that the symphony is the shortest possible distance
between them. Such, in a sense, has been the classical
ideal, and thus we find Prokofieff completing the symphonic
cycle of his career by returning once more,
whether by inner compulsion or outer necessity, to
a classical symphony.</p>
<h2 id="c3">PIANO CONCERTOS</h2>
<h3 class="generic"><i>Concerto No. 1, in D-flat major, Opus 10, for Piano and Orchestra</i></h3>
<p>Prokofieff&rsquo;s first piano concerto was his declaration
of maturity, according to Nestyev. It followed the
composition in 1911 of a one-act opera, &ldquo;Magdalene&rdquo;
that proved little more than an advanced student
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
exercise for the operatic writing that was to come
later. That same year Prokofieff completed his concerto
and dedicated it to Nicolai Tcherepnine. Its
performance in Moscow early the following year,
followed by a performance in St. Petersburg, served
to establish his name as one to conjure with among
Russia&rsquo;s rising new generation of composers. The
work suggested the tradition of Franz Liszt in its
propulsive energy and strictly pianistic language. But
it revealed the compactness of idiom and phrase, the
pointed turn of phrase, and lithe rhythmic tension
that were to develop and characterize so much of
Prokofieff&rsquo;s subsequent music. The Concerto brought
a fervid response, but not all of it was on Prokofieff&rsquo;s
side. &ldquo;Harsh, coarse, primitive cacophony&rdquo; was the
verdict of one Moscow critic. Another proposed a
straitjacket for its young composer. On the other
side of the ledger, critics in both cities welcomed its
humor and wit and imaginative quality, not to mention
&ldquo;its freedom from the mildew of decadence.&rdquo;
A particularly prophetic voice had this to say:
&ldquo;Prokofieff might even mark a stage in Russian musical
development, Glinka and Rubinstein being the first,
Tschaikowsky and Rimsky-Korsakoff the second,
Glazounoff and Arensky the third, and Scriabin and
Prokofieff the fourth.&rdquo; Daringly this prophet asked:
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Prokofieff was his own soloist on these occasions,
and it was soon apparent that besides being a composer
of emphatic power and originality, he was a
pianist of prodigious virtuosity. &ldquo;Under his fingers,&rdquo;
ran one report, &ldquo;the piano does not so much sing and
vibrate as speak in the stern and convincing tone of
a percussion instrument, the tone of the old-fashioned
harpsichord. Yet it was precisely this convincing freedom
of execution and these clear-cut rhythms that
won the author such enthusiastic applause from the
public.&rdquo; Most confident and discerning of all at this
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
time was Miaskovsky, who, reviewing a set of Four
Etudes by Prokofieff, challengingly stated: &ldquo;What
pleasure and surprise it affords one to come across
this vivid and wholesome phenomenon amid the
morass of effeminacy, spinelessness, and anemia of
today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The First Piano Concerto was introduced to America
at a concert of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on
December 11, 1918. The conductor was Eric De
Lamarter, and the soloist was again Prokofieff himself.</p>
<p>The Concerto is in one uninterrupted movement,
Prokofieff considering the whole &ldquo;an allegro movement
in sonata form.&rdquo; While the music ventures among
many tonalities before its journey is over, it ends the
way it began, in the key of D flat major. One gains
the impression, though only in passing, of a three-movement
structure because of two sections marked,
respectively, <i>Andante</i> and <i>Allegro scherzando</i>, which
follow the opening <i>Allegro brioso</i>. Actually the
<i>Andante</i>, a sustained lyrical discourse, featuring, by
turn, strings, solo clarinet, solo piano, and finally
piano and orchestra, is a songful pause between the
exposition and development of this sonata plan. When
the <i>Andante</i> has reached its peak, the <i>Allegro
scherzando</i> begins, developing themes already presented
in the earlier section. One is reminded of the
cyclical recurrence of theme adopted by Liszt in his
piano concertos, both of which are also in one movement,
though subdivided within the unbroken
continuity of the music.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><i>Concerto No. 2 in G minor, Opus 16, for Piano and Orchestra</i></h3>
<p>The Second Piano Concerto of Prokofieff belongs
to the lost and found department of music. It was
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
written early in 1913, that is, two years after the First
Concerto, and performed for the first time, with
Prokofieff at the keyboard, on August 23 at Pavlovsk,
a town not far from St. Petersburg. A performance,
with the same soloist, took place at a concert of the
Russian Musical Society on January 24, 1915. Early
the following month Prokofieff left for Italy at the
invitation of Sergei Diaghileff, who liked the Concerto
and for a while even toyed with the possibility of
using it for a ballet. On March 7, 1915 Prokofieff,
through the intervention of Diaghileff, performed
his Second Concerto at the Augusteo, Rome, the conductor
being Bernardino Molinari. The reaction of
the Italian press was pretty much that of the Russian
press&mdash;divided. There were again those who decried
Prokofieff&rsquo;s bold innovations of color and rhythm and
harmony, and there were those who hailed these very
things. There was one point of unanimity, however.
One and all, in both countries, acclaimed Prokofieff
as a pianist of brilliance and distinction.</p>
<p>Now, when Prokofieff left Russia for the United
States in 1918, the score of the Second Piano Concerto
remained behind in his apartment in the city that
became Leningrad. This score, together with the
orchestral parts and other manuscripts, were lost when
Prokofieff&rsquo;s apartment was confiscated during the revolutionary
exigencies of the period. Luckily, sketches
of the piano part were salvaged by Prokofieff&rsquo;s mother,
and returned to him in 1921. Working from these
sketches, Prokofieff partly reconstructed and partly
rewrote his Second Piano Concerto. There is considerable
difference between the two versions. Both the
basic structure and the themes of the original were
retained, but the concerto could now boast whatever
Prokofieff had gained in imaginative and technical
resource in the intervening years. Thus reshaped, the
Second Piano Concerto was first performed in Paris
with the composer as soloist, and Serge Koussevitzky
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
conducting. The following analysis, used on that
occasion, and later translated by Philip Hale and
extensively quoted in this country, was probably the
work of Prokofieff, who was generally quite hospitable
to requests for technical expositions of his music.</p>
<p>I. <i>Andantino-Allegretto-Andantino.</i> The movement
begins with the announcement of the first theme, to
which is opposed a second episode of a faster pace
in A minor. The piano enters solo in a technically
complicated cadenza, with a repetition of the first
episode in the first part.</p>
<p>II. <i>Scherzo.</i> This <i>Scherzo</i> is in the nature of a
<i>moto perpetuo</i> in 16th notes by the two hands in the
interval of an octave, while the orchestral accompaniment
furnishes the background.</p>
<p>III. <i>Intermezzo.</i> This movement, <i>moderato</i>, is conceived
in a strictly classical form.</p>
<p>IV. <i>Finale.</i> After several measures in quick movement
the first subject is given to the piano. The second
is of a calmer, more cantabile nature&mdash;piano solo at
first&mdash;followed by several canons for piano and
orchestra. Later the two themes are joined, the piano
playing one, the orchestra the other. There is a short
coda based chiefly upon the first subject.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><i>Concerto No. 3, in C major, Opus 26, for Piano and Orchestra</i></h3>
<p>Prokofieff did not begin work on his Third Piano
Concerto till four years after he had completed the
first version of his Second Concerto. This was in
1917 in the St. Petersburg that was now Petrograd
and was soon to be Leningrad. However, a combination
of war and revolution, plus a departure for
America in 1918, and the busy schedule that followed,
delayed completion of the work. It was not until
October, 1921, in fact, that the score was ready for
performance, and that event took place at a concert
of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on the following
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
December 17. Prokofieff was again the soloist, as he
is once more his own annotator in the analysis that
follows.</p>
<p>I. The first movement opens quietly with a short
introduction, Andante, 4-4. The theme is announced
by an unaccompanied clarinet, and is continued by
the violins for a few bars. Soon the tempo changes
to Allegro, the strings having a passage in semiquavers
which leads to the statement of the principal subject
by the piano. Discussion of this theme is carried on in
a lively manner, both the piano and the orchestra
having a good deal to say on the matter. A passage
in chords for the piano alone leads to the more
expressive second subject, heard in the oboe with a
pizzicato accompaniment. This is taken up by the
piano and developed at some length, eventually giving
way to a bravura passage in triplets. At the climax
of this section, the tempo reverts to Andante, and the
orchestra gives out the first theme, ff. The piano joins
in, and the theme is subjected to an impressively broad
treatment. On resuming the Allegro, the chief theme
and the second subject are developed with increased
brilliance, and the movement ends with an exciting
crescendo.</p>
<p>II. The second movement consists of a theme with
five variations. The theme is announced by the orchestra
alone, <i>Andantino</i>.</p>
<p>In the first variation, the piano treats the opening
of the theme in quasi-sentimental fashion, and resolves
into a chain of trills, as the orchestra repeats the
closing phrase. The tempo changes to Allegro for the
second and the third variations, and the piano has
brilliant figures, while snatches of the theme are introduced
here and there in the orchestra. In variation
Four the tempo is once again <i>Andante</i>, and the piano
and orchestra discourse on the theme in a quiet and
meditative fashion. Variation Five is energetic
(Allegro giusto). It leads without pause into a restatement
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
of the theme by the orchestra, with delicate
chordal embroidery in the piano.</p>
<p>III. The Finale begins (Allegro ma non troppo,
3-4) with a staccato theme for bassoons and pizzicato
strings, which is interrupted by the blustering entry
of the piano. The orchestra holds its own with the
opening theme, however, and there is a good deal
of argument, with frequent differences of opinion as
regards key. Eventually the piano takes up the first
theme, and develops it to a climax.</p>
<p>IV. With a reduction of tone and slackening of
tempo, an alternative theme is introduced in the woodwind.
The piano replies with a theme that is more in
keeping with the caustic humor of the work. This
material is developed and there is a brilliant coda.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>It was Prokofieff&rsquo;s Third Piano Concerto that
launched a young Greek musician by the name of
Dimitri Mitropoulos on a brilliant international career.
Mr. Mitropoulos had been invited to Berlin in 1930
to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic. Egon Petri, the
celebrated Dutch pianist, was scheduled to appear as
soloist in the Prokofieff Third. But Mr. Petri was
indisposed and no other pianist was available to
replace him in time for the concert. To save the situation
Mr. Mitropoulos volunteered to play the concerto
himself. The result was a spectacular double debut in
Berlin for the young musician as conductor and
pianist. Engaged to conduct in Paris soon after,
Mr. Mitropoulos again billed Prokofieff&rsquo;s Third Piano
Concerto, with himself once more as soloist. This
time he was heard by Prokofieff, who stated publicly
that the Greek played it better than he himself could
ever hope to. Word of Mr. Mitropoulos&rsquo;s European
triumphs reached Serge Koussevitzky, who immediately
invited him to come to America as guest conductor
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. It is no
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
wonder that Dimitri Mitropoulos often refers to this
concerto as &ldquo;the lucky Prokofieff Third.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="generic"><i>Concerto No. 5, Opus 55, for Piano and Orchestra</i></h3>
<p>Before concerning ourselves with Prokofieff&rsquo;s Fifth
Piano Concerto, a few words are needed to explain
this leap from No. 3 to No. 5. A fourth piano concerto
is listed in the catalogue as Opus 53, dating
from 1931, consisting of four movements, and still
in manuscript. A significant reference to its being
&ldquo;for the left hand&rdquo; begins to tell us a story. Prokofieff
wrote it for a popular Austrian pianist, Paul Wittgenstein,
who had lost his right arm in the First
World War. Wittgenstein had already been armed
with special scores by such versatile worthies as
Richard Strauss, Erich Korngold, and Franz Schmidt.
Prokofieff responded with alacrity when Wittgenstein
approached him too. The Concerto, bristling with
titanic difficulties and a complex stylistic scheme that
would have baffled two hands if not two brains, was
submitted for inspection to the one-armed virtuoso.
Wittgenstein disliked it cordially, refused to perform
it, and thus consigned it to the silence of a manuscript.</p>
<p>Maurice Ravel, approached in due course for a
similar work, was the only composer to emerge with
an enduring work from contact with this gifted
casualty of the war. However, he too had trouble.
When completed, the Concerto was virtually deeded
to the pianist. Wittgenstein now proceeded to object
to numerous passages and to insist on alterations.
Ravel angrily refused, and was anything but mollified
to discover that Wittgenstein was taking &ldquo;unpardonable
liberties&rdquo; in public performances of the concerto....
Perhaps it was just as well that Prokofieff&rsquo;s
Fourth Piano Concerto remained in its unperformed
innocence&mdash;a concerto for no hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>It was not long before the mood to compose a
piano concerto was upon Prokofieff again. This became
his Fifth, finished in the summer of 1932 and
performed for the first time in Berlin at a Philharmonic
Concert conducted by Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler. Prokofieff
was the soloist. It is interesting to note that the
program contained another soloist&mdash;the gentleman
playing the viola part in Berlioz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Childe Harold
Symphony,&rdquo; a gentleman by the name of Paul Hindemith.
There was a performance of the Concerto in
Paris two months later.</p>
<p>When the concerto and the composer reached
Boston together the following year, Prokofieff gave
an interviewer from the &ldquo;Transcript&rdquo; both a description
of the way he composed and an analysis of the
score. About his method Prokofieff had this to say:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am always on the lookout for new melodic
themes. These I write in a notebook, as they come to
me, for future use. All my work is founded on
melodies. When I begin a work of major proportions
I usually have accumulated enough themes to make
half-a-dozen symphonies. Then the work of selection
and arrangement begins. The composition of this
Fifth Concerto began with such melodies. I had enough
of them to make three concertos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His analysis follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The emphasis in this concerto is entirely on the
melodic. There are five movements, and each movement
contains at least four themes or melodies. The
development of these themes is exceedingly compact
and concise. This will be evident when I tell you
that the entire five movements do not take over twenty
minutes in performance. Please do not misunderstand
me. The themes are not without development. In a
work such as Schumann&rsquo;s &lsquo;Carnival&rsquo; there are also
many themes, enough to make a considerable number
of symphonies or concertos. But they are not developed
at all. They are merely stated. In my new
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
Concerto there is actual development of the themes,
but this development is as compressed and condensed
as possible. Of course there is no program, not a sign
or suggestion of a program. But neither is there any
movement so expansive as to be a complete sonata-form.</p>
<p>I. <i>Allegro con brio: meno mosso.</i> &ldquo;The first movement
is an <i>Allegro con brio</i>, with a <i>meno mosso</i> as
middle section. Though not in a sonata-form, it is the
main movement of the Concerto, fulfills the functions
of a sonata-form and is in the spirit of the usual
sonata-form.</p>
<p>II. <i>Moderato ben accentuato.</i> &ldquo;This movement has
a march-like rhythm, but we must be cautious in the
use of this term. I would not think of calling it a
march because it has none of the vulgarity or commonness
which is so often associated with the idea
of a march and which actually exists in most popular
marches.</p>
<p>III. <i>Allegro con fuoco.</i> &ldquo;The third movement is a
Toccata. This is a precipitate, displayful movement
of much technical brilliance and requiring a large
virtuosity&mdash;as difficult for orchestra as for the soloist.
It is a Toccata for orchestra as much as for piano.</p>
<p>IV. <i>Larghetto.</i> &ldquo;The fourth movement is the lyrical
movement of the Concerto. It starts off with a soft,
soothing theme: grows more and more intense in
the middle portion, develops breadth and tension, then
returns to the music of the beginning. German commentators
have mistakenly called it a theme and
variations.</p>
<p>V. <i>Vivo: Piu Mosso: Coda.</i> &ldquo;The Finale has a
decidedly classical flavor. The Coda is based on a
new theme which is joined by the other themes of the
Finale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Summing up his own view of the Concerto, Prokofieff
concluded:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Concerto is not cyclic in the Franckian sense
of developing several movements out of the theme
or set of themes. Each movement has its own independent
themes. But there is reference to some of the
material of the First Movement in the Third; and
also reference to the material of the Third Movement
in the Finale. The piano part is treated in <i>concertante</i>
fashion. The piano always has the leading part which
is closely interwoven with significant music in the
orchestra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this rather mild and dispassionate self-appraisal,
it comes as something of a shock to read
the slashing commentary of Prokofieff&rsquo;s Soviet biographer
Nestyev:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The machine-like Toccata, in the athletic style of
the earlier Prokofieff, presents his bold jumps, hand-crossing,
and Scarlatti technic in highly exaggerated
form. The tendency to wide skips &agrave; la Scarlatti is
carried to monstrous extremes. Sheer feats of piano
acrobatics completely dominate the principal movements
of the Concerto. In the precipitate Toccata
this dynamic quality degenerates into mere lifeless
mechanical movement, with the result that the orchestra
itself seems to be transformed into a huge mechanism
with fly-wheels, pistons, and transmission
belts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Nestyev it was further proof of the &ldquo;brittle,
urbanistic&rdquo; sterility of Prokofieff&rsquo;s &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo;
wanderings.</p>
<h2 id="c4">VIOLIN CONCERTOS</h2>
<h3 class="generic"><i>Concerto in D major, No. 1, Opus 19, for Violin and Orchestra</i></h3>
<p>Although composed in Russia between 1913 and
1917, Prokofieff&rsquo;s First Violin Concerto did not see
the light of day till October 18, 1923, that is to say,
shortly after he had taken up residence in Paris. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
was on that date that the work was first performed
in the French capital at a concert conducted by Serge
Koussevitzky, who entrusted the solo part to his concertmaster
Marcel Darrieux. The same violinist was
soloist at a subsequent concert in the Colonne concert
series, on November 25. It is said that the work was
assigned to a concertmaster after Mr. Koussevitzky
had been rebuffed by several established artists, among
them the celebrated Bronislaw Hubermann, who relished
neither its idiom nor its technic. This attitude
was shared by the Paris critics, who expressed an
almost uniform hostility to the concerto. Prokofieff&rsquo;s
arrival in Paris had already been prepared by his
&ldquo;Scythian Suite&rdquo; and Third Piano Concerto. The new
work must evidently have struck Parisian ears as
rather mild and Mendelssohnian by comparison. In
any case, the Violin Concerto did not gain serious
recognition till it was performed in Prague on June 1
of the following year at a festival of the International
Society for Contemporary Music. The soloist this time
was Joseph Szigeti, and it was thanks in large part
to his working sponsorship of the Concerto that it
began to gather momentum on the international concert
circuit. Serge Koussevitzky was again the conductor
when the work was given its American premiere
by the Boston Symphony Orchestra on April 24,
1925, and once more the soloist was a concertmaster&mdash;Richard
Burgin.</p>
<p>The D major Violin Concerto shows the period
of its composition in its frequent traces of the national
school of Rimsky-Korsakoff and Glazounoff. Despite
the bustling intricacies of the second movement, it is
not a virtuoso&rsquo;s paradise by any means. Bravura of
the rampant kind is absent, and of cadenzas there is
no sign. Neither is the orchestra an accompaniment
in the traditional sense, but rather part of the same
integrated scheme of which the solo-violin is merely
a prominent feature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>I. <i>Andantino.</i> The solo violin chants a gentle theme
against which the strings and clarinet weave in equally
gentle background. There is a spirited change of mood
as the melody is followed by rhythmic passage-work
sustained over a marked bass. The first theme returns
as the movement draws to a close, more deliberate
now. The flute takes it up as the violin embroiders
richly around it.</p>
<p>II. <i>Vivacissimo.</i> This is a swiftly moving scherzo,
bristling with accented rhythms, long leaps, double-stop
slides and harmonics, and down-bow strokes,
&ldquo;none of which,&rdquo; Robert Bagar shrewdly points out,
&ldquo;may be construed as display music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III. <i>Moderato.</i> More lyrical than the preceding
movement, the finale allows the violin frolic to continue
to some extent. Scale passages are developed
and high-flown trills give the violin some heady moments.
The bassoon offers a coy theme before the
violin introduces the main subject in a sequence of
staccato and legato phrases. There are pointed comments
from a restless orchestra as the material is
developed. Soon the soft melody of the opening movement
is heard again, among the massed violins now.
Above it the solo instrument soars in trills on a parallel
line of notes an octave above, coming to rest on
high D.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><i>Concerto in G minor, No. 2, Op. 63, for Violin and Orchestra</i></h3>
<p>Composed during the summer and autumn of 1935,
Prokofieff&rsquo;s second violin concerto was premiered in
Madrid on December 1 of that year. Enrique Arbos
conducted the Madrid Symphony Orchestra, with the
Belgian violinist Robert Soetens playing the solo part.
Prokofieff himself was present and later directed the
same orchestra in his &ldquo;Classical Symphony.&rdquo; Jascha
Heifetz was the soloist when Serge Koussevitzky and
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
the Boston Symphony Orchestra first performed the
new concerto in America.</p>
<p>Twenty-two years had elapsed since Prokofieff had
composed his first violin concerto in D, so comparisons
were promptly made between the styles and
idioms manifested by the two scores. Apart from the
normal development and change expected over so
long a period, another factor was emphasized by
many. The G minor concerto marked Prokofieff&rsquo;s
return to his homeland after a long Odyssey abroad.
He was now a Soviet citizen and once more a participant
in the social and cultural life of his country.</p>
<p>The new concerto revealed a warmth and lyricism,
even a romantic spirit, that contrasted with the witty
glitter and grotesquerie of the early concerto. The old
terseness, rigorous logic, and clear-cut form were still
observable, though less pronounced. There were even
flashes of the &ldquo;familiar Prokofieffian naughtiness,&rdquo; as
Gerald Abraham pointed out. But the new mood was
inescapable. &ldquo;So far as the violin concerto form is
concerned,&rdquo; wrote the English musicologist, &ldquo;Prokofieff&rsquo;s
formula for turning himself into a Soviet composer
has been to emphasize the lyrical side of his
nature at the expense of the witty and grotesque and
brilliant sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The daring thrusts, the crisp waggishness, the fiendish
cleverness and steely glitter seemed now to be
giving way to warmer, deeper preoccupations, at
least in the first two movements. &ldquo;The renascence of
lyricism, warm melody, and simple emotionality is
the essence of the second violin concerto,&rdquo; writes
Abraham Veinus. The earlier spirit of mockery and
tart irreverence was almost lost in the new surge of
romantic melody.</p>
<p>I. <i>Allegro moderato, G minor, 4/4.</i> The solo instrument,
unaccompanied, gives out a readily remembered
first theme which forms the basis of the subsequent
development and the coda. The appealing second
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
theme is also announced by the violin, this time against
soft rhythmic figures in the string section. Abraham
finds a &ldquo;distant affinity&rdquo; between this second theme
and the Gavotte of Prokofieff&rsquo;s &ldquo;Classical Symphony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II. <i>Andante assai, E-flat major, 12/8.</i> The shift to
frank melodic appeal is especially noticeable in the
slow movement. Here the mood is almost steadily
lyrical and romantic from the moment the violin sings
the theme which forms the basic material of the movement.
There is varied treatment and some shifting in
tonality before the chief melody returns to the key
of E-flat.</p>
<p>III. <i>Allegro ben marcato, G minor, 3/4.</i> In the finale
the old Prokofieff is back in a brilliant Rondo of
incisive rhythms and flashing melodic fragments.
There are bold staccato effects, tricky shifts in rhythm,
and brisk repartee between violin and orchestra. If
there is any obvious link with the earlier concerto in
D it is here in this virtuoso&rsquo;s playground.</p>
<h2 id="c5">SUITES</h2>
<h3 class="generic"><i>&ldquo;Ala and Lolly&rdquo;, Scythian Suite for Large Orchestra, Opus 20</i></h3>
<p>It has been supposed that, consciously or not,
Prokofieff was influenced by Stravinsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sacre de
Printemps&rdquo; in his choice and treatment of material
for the &ldquo;Scythian Suite.&rdquo; Both scores have an earthy,
barbaric quality, a stark rhythmic pulsation and an
atmosphere of remote pagan ritualism that establish
a strong kinship, whether direct or not. In each instance,
moreover, the subject matter allowed the composer
ample scope for exploiting fresh devices of
harmony and color. Another point of contact between
the two scores was the figure of Serge Diaghileff,
that fabulous patron and gadfly of modern art. Stravinsky
had already been brought into the camp of
Russian ballet by this most persuasive of all ballet
impressarios. Soon it was Prokofieff&rsquo;s turn. Diaghileff&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
commission was a ballet &ldquo;on Russian fairy-tale or
prehistoric themes.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Scythian&rdquo; music was Prokofieff&rsquo;s
answer. The encounter with Diaghileff had
occurred in June, 1914. With the outbreak of war
later that year, an unavoidable delay set in, and it
was evidently not till early the next year that Prokofieff
submitted what was ready to Diaghileff, who liked
neither the plot nor the music. To compensate him
for his pains Diaghileff did two things: The first was
to arrange for Prokofieff to play his Second Piano
Concerto in Rome, an experience that proved profitable
in every sense. The second was to commission
another ballet, with the injunction to &ldquo;write music
that will be truly Russian.&rdquo; To which the candid
Diaghileff added:&mdash;&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve forgotten how to write
music in that rotten St. Petersburg of yours.&rdquo; The
result was &ldquo;The Buffoon,&rdquo; a ballet which proved more
palatable to Diaghileff and led to a mutually fruitful
association of many years.</p>
<p>What was to have been the &ldquo;Scythian&rdquo; ballet
became instead, an orchestral suite, the premiere of
which took place in St. Petersburg on January 29,
1916, Prokofieff himself conducting. More than any
other score of Prokofieff&rsquo;s, the &ldquo;Scythian Suite&rdquo; was
responsible for the acrimonious note that long remained
in the reaction of the press to his music.
&ldquo;Cacophony&rdquo; became a frequent word in the vocabulary
of invective favored by hostile critics. Prokofieff
was accused of breaking every musical law and violating
every tenet of good taste. His music was &ldquo;noisy,&rdquo;
&ldquo;rowdy,&rdquo; &ldquo;barbarous,&rdquo; an expression of irresponsible
hooliganism in symphonic form. Glazounoff, friend
and teacher and guide, walked out on the first performance
of &ldquo;The Scythian Suite.&rdquo; But there were
those among the critics and public who recognized
the confident power and proclamative freedom of this
music, and so a merry war of words, written and
spoken, brewed over a score that Diaghileff, in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
moment of singular insensitivity, had dismissed as
&ldquo;dull.&rdquo; Whatever else this music was&mdash;and it was
almost everything from a signal for angry stampedes
from the concert hall to an open declaration of war&mdash;it
was emphatically not dull! Even the word &ldquo;Bolshevism&rdquo;
was hurled at the score when it reached these
placid shores late in 1918. In Chicago, one critic
wrote: &ldquo;The red flag of anarchy waved tempestuously
over old Orchestra Hall yesterday as Bolshevist
melodies floated over the waves of a sea of sound in
breath-taking cacophony.&rdquo; Dull, indeed!</p>
<p>Of the original Scythians whose strange customs
were the subject of Prokofieff&rsquo;s controversial suite,
Robert Bagar tells us succinctly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;First believed to have been mentioned by the poet
Hesiod (800 B.C.), the Scythians were a nomadic
people dwelling along the north shore of the Black
Sea. Probably of Mongol blood, this race vanished
about 100 B.C. Herodotus tells us that they were
rather an evil lot, given to very primitive customs,
fat and flabby in appearance, and living under a
despotic rule whose laws, such as they may have been,
were enforced through the ever-present threat of
assassination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were gods, of course, each in charge of
some aspect or other of spiritual or human or moral
conduct&mdash;a sun god, a health god, a heaven god, an
evil god and quite a few others. Veles, the god of the
sun, was their supreme deity. His daughter was Ala,
and Lolli was one of their great heroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prokofieff&rsquo;s Suite is based on the story of Ala, her
suffering in the toils of the Evil God, and her deliverance
by Lolli. The suite is divided into four movements,
brief outlines of which are furnished in the
score.</p>
<p>I. &ldquo;<i>Invocation to Veles and Ala.</i>&rdquo; (<i>Allegro feroce,
4/4.</i>) The music describes an invocation to the sun,
worshipped by the Scythians as their highest deity,
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
named Veles. This invocation is followed by the sacrifice
to the beloved idol, Ala, the daughter of Veles.</p>
<p>II. &ldquo;<i>The Evil-God and dance of the pagan monsters.</i>&rdquo;
(<i>Allegro sostenuto, 4-4</i>.) The Evil-God summons
the seven pagan monsters from their subterranean
realms and, surrounded by them, dances a
delirious dance.</p>
<p>III. &ldquo;<i>Night.</i>&rdquo; (<i>Andantino, 4-4.</i>) The Evil-God
comes to Ala in the darkness. Great harm befalls her.
The moon rays fall upon Ala, and the moon-maidens
descend to bring her consolation.</p>
<p>IV. &ldquo;<i>Lolli&rsquo;s pursuit of the Evil-God and the sunrise.</i>&rdquo;
(<i>Tempestuoso, 4-4.</i>) Lolli, a Scythian hero, went
forth to save Ala. He fights the Evil-God. In the
uneven battle with the latter, Lolli would have perished,
but the sun-god rises with the passing of night
and smites the evil deity. With the description of the
sunrise the Suite comes to an end.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><i>Orchestral Suite from the Film, &ldquo;Lieutenant Kije,&rdquo; Opus 60</i></h3>
<p>The Soviet film, &ldquo;Lieutenant Kije&rdquo;, was produced
by the Belgoskino Studios of Leningrad in 1933, after
a story by Y. Tynyanov that had become a classic of
the new literature. The director was A. Feinzimmer.
For Prokofieff, who supplied the music, it represented
the first important work of his return to Russia. The
music belongs with that for &ldquo;Alexander Nevsky&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Ivan the Terrible&rdquo; as the most effective and characteristic
Prokofieff composed for the Soviet screen.
From that score Prokofieff assembled an orchestral
suite which was published early in 1934 and performed
later that year in Moscow. Prokofieff himself
conducted its Parisian premiere at a Lamoureux concert
on February 20, 1937, when, according to an
English correspondent, it &ldquo;made a stunning impression.&rdquo;
Serge Koussevitzky introduced it to America
at a concert of the Boston Symphony Orchestra on
October 15 of the same year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The film tells an ironic and amusing story of a
Russian officer, who because of a clerical error, existed
only on paper. The setting is that of St. Petersburg
during the reign of Czar Paul. The Czar misreads
the report of one of his military aides, and without
meaning to, evolves the name of a non-existent lieutenant.
He does this by inadvertently linking the &ldquo;ki&rdquo;
at the end of another officer&rsquo;s name to the Russian
expletive &ldquo;je.&rdquo; The result is the birth&mdash;on paper&mdash;of
a new officer in the Russian Army, &ldquo;Lieutenant
Kije.&rdquo; Since no one dares to tell the Czar of his absurd
blunder, his courtiers are obliged to invent a &ldquo;Lieutenant
Kije&rdquo; to go with the name. Such being the
situation, the film is an enlargement on the expedients
and subterfuges arising from it. There are five
sections:&mdash;</p>
<p>I. <i>Birth of Kije.</i> (<i>Allegro.</i>) A combination of off-stage
cornet fanfare, military drum-roll, and squealings
from a fife proclaim that Lieutenant Kije is
born&mdash;in the brain of blundering Czar. The solemn
announcement is taken up by other instruments,
followed by a short <i>Andante</i> section, and presently
the military clatter of the opening is back.</p>
<p>II. <i>Romance.</i> (<i>Andante.</i>) This section contains a
song, assigned optionally to baritone voice or tenor
saxophone. The text of the song, in translation,
reads:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Heart be calm, do not flutter;</p>
<p class="t0">Don&rsquo;t keep flying like a butterfly.</p>
<p class="t0">Well, what has my heart decided?</p>
<p class="t0">Where will we in summer rest?</p>
<p class="t0">But my heart could answer nothing,</p>
<p class="t0">Beating fast in my poor breast.</p>
<p class="t0">My grey dove is full of sorrow&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Moaning is she day and night.</p>
<p class="t0">For her dear companion left her,</p>
<p class="t0">Having vanished out of sight,</p>
<p class="t0">Sad and dull has gotten my grey dove.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>III. <i>Kije&rsquo;s Wedding.</i> (<i>Allegro.</i>) This section reminds
us that although our hero is truly a soldier, like so
many of his calling he is also susceptible to the claims
of the heart. In fact, he is quite a dashing lover, not
without a touch of sentimentality.</p>
<p>IV. <i>Troika.</i> (<i>Moderato.</i>) The Russian word &ldquo;Troika&rdquo;
means a set of three, then, by extension, a team of
three horses abreast, finally, a three-horse sleigh. This
section is so named because the orchestra pictures
such a vehicle as accompaniment to a second song,
in this case a Russian tavern song. Its words, as rendered
from the Russian, go:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s heart is like an inn:</p>
<p class="t0">All those who wish go in,</p>
<p class="t0">And they who roam about</p>
<p class="t0">Day and night go in and out.</p>
<p class="t0">Come here, I say; come here, I say,</p>
<p class="t0">And have no fear with me.</p>
<p class="t0">Be you bachelor or not,</p>
<p class="t0">Be you shy or be you bold,</p>
<p class="t0">I call you all to come here.</p>
<p class="t0">So all those who are about,</p>
<p class="t0">Keep going in and coming out,</p>
<p class="t0">Night and day they roam about.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>V. <i>Burial of Kije.</i> (<i>Andante assai</i>.) Thus ends the
paper career of our valiant hero. The music recalls
his birth to a flourish of military sounds, his romance,
his wedding. And now the cornet that had blithely
announced his coming in an off-stage fanfare is muted
to his going, as Lieutenant Kije dwindles to his final
silence.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><i>Music for the Ballet, &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo; Opus 64-A and 64-B</i></h3>
<p>As a ballet in four acts and nine tableaux, Prokofieff&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; was first produced by the
Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow in 1935. Like many standard
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
Russian ballets, the performance took a whole
evening. Prokofieff assembled two Suites from the
music, the first premiered in Moscow on November
24, 1936, under the direction of Nicolas Semjonowitsch
Golowanow. The premiere of the second suite
followed less than a month later.</p>
<p>Prokofieff himself directed the American premieres
of both Suites, of Suite No. 1 as guest of the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra on January 21, 1937, and of
Suite No. 2 as guest of the Boston Symphony Orchestra
on March 25, 1938. Serge Koussevitzky and the
Boston unit introduced the Suite to New York on
March 31 following.</p>
<p>After a trial performance of the ballet in Moscow
V. V. Konin reported to the &ldquo;Musical Courier&rdquo; that
Soviet critics present were &ldquo;left in dismay at the awkward
incongruity between the realistic idiom of the
musical language, a language which successfully characterizes
the individualism of the Shakespearean
images, and the blind submission to the worst traditions
of the old form, as revealed in the libretto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fault was also found because &ldquo;the social atmosphere
of the period and the natural evolution of its tragic
elements had been robbed of their logical culmination
and brought to the ridiculously dissonant &lsquo;happy end&rsquo;
of the conventional ballet. This inconsistency in the
development of the libretto has had an unfortunate
effect, not only upon the general structure, but even
upon the otherwise excellent musical score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Critical reaction to both Suites has varied, some
reviewers finding the music dry and insipid for such
a romantic theme; others hailing its pungency and
color. Prokofieff&rsquo;s classicism was compared with his
romanticism. If we are prepared to accept the &ldquo;Classical&rdquo;
Symphony as truly classical, said one critic, then
we must accept the &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; music as
truly romantic. The cold, cheerless, dreary music &ldquo;is
certainly not love music,&rdquo; read one verdict. Prokofieff
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
was taken to task for describing a love story &ldquo;as if it
were an algebraic problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Olin Downes of &ldquo;The New York Times&rdquo; in his
review of the Boston Symphony concert of March 31,
1938:&mdash;&ldquo;The music is predominantly satirical....
There is the partial suggestion of that which is poignant
and tragic, but there is little of the sensuous or
emotional, and in the main the music could bear almost
any title and still serve the ballet evolutions and
have nothing to do with Romeo and Juliet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others extolled Prokofieff for the &ldquo;fundamental
simplicity and buoyancy&rdquo; of the music, finding it
typically rooted in the &ldquo;plane, tangible realities of
tone, design, and color.&rdquo; Prokofieff himself answered
the repeated charge that his score lacked feeling and
melody:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every now and then somebody or other starts urging
me to put more feeling, more emotion, more melody
in my music. My own conviction is that there is
plenty of all that in it. I have never shunned the expression
of feeling and have always been intent on
creating melody&mdash;but new melody, which perhaps
certain listeners do not recognize as such simply because
it does not resemble closely enough the kind of
melody to which they are accustomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; I have taken special pains
to achieve a simplicity which will, I hope, reach the
hearts of all listeners. If people find no melody and no
emotion in this work, I shall be very sorry. But I feel
sure that sooner or later they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the First Suite which Prokofieff prepared for
concert purposes, there are seven numbers, outlined as
follows:&mdash;1) &ldquo;Folk Dance&rdquo;; 2) &ldquo;Scene&rdquo;; 3) &ldquo;Madrigal&rdquo;;
4) &ldquo;Minuet&rdquo;; 5) &ldquo;Masques&rdquo;; 6) &ldquo;Romeo and
Juliet&rdquo;; and 7) &ldquo;The Death of Tybalt&rdquo;. Perhaps the
most significant and absorbing of these is &ldquo;Masques&rdquo;,
an <i>Andante marciale</i> of majestic sweep and power,
which accompanies the action at the Capulet ball,
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
leading to the unobserved entrance into the palace of
Romeo and two friends, wearing masks. One senses a
brooding, sinister prophecy in the measured stateliness
of the music. Searing and incisive in its pitiless
evocation is &ldquo;The Death of Tybalt&rdquo;, marked <i>Precipitato</i>
in the score. Both street duels are depicted in
this section, the first in which Tybalt slays Mercutio,
the other in which Romeo, in revenge, slays Tybalt.
Capulet&rsquo;s denunciation follows. This First Suite is
listed as Opus 64-A in the catalogue of Prokofieff&rsquo;s
works.</p>
<p>The Second Suite, Opus 64-B, also consists of seven
numbers:&mdash;</p>
<p>1) &ldquo;<i>Montagues and Capulets</i>&rdquo;. (<i>Allegro pesante</i>).
This is intended to portray satirically the proud,
haughty characters of the noblemen. There is a <i>Trio</i>
in which Juliet and Paris are pictured as dancing.</p>
<p>2) &ldquo;<i>Juliet, the Maiden</i>&rdquo;. (<i>Vivace</i>). The main theme
portrays the innocent and lighthearted Juliet, tender
and free of suspicion. As the section develops we sense
a gradual deepening of her feelings.</p>
<p>3) &ldquo;<i>Friar Laurence</i>&rdquo;. (<i>Andante espressivo</i>). Two
themes are used to identify the Friar&mdash;bassoons,
tuba, and harps announce the first; &rsquo;cellos, the second.</p>
<p>4) &ldquo;<i>Dance</i>&rdquo;. (<i>Vivo</i>).</p>
<p>5) &ldquo;<i>The Parting of Romeo and Juliet</i>&rdquo;. (<i>Lento.
Poco piu animato</i>). An elaborately worked out fabric
woven mainly from the theme of Romeo&rsquo;s love for
Juliet.</p>
<p>6) &ldquo;<i>Dance of the West Indian Slave Girls</i>&rdquo;. (<i>Andante
con eleganza</i>). The section accompanies both
the action of Paris presenting pearls to Juliet and slave
girls dancing with the pearls.</p>
<p>7) &ldquo;<i>Romeo at Juliet&rsquo;s Grave</i>&rdquo;. (<i>Adagio funebre</i>).
Prokofieff captures the anguish and pathos of the
heartbreaking blunder that is the ultimate in tragedy:
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
Juliet is not really dead, and her tomb is only that in
appearance&mdash;but for Romeo the illusion is reality
and his grief is unbounded.</p>
<p>Prokofieff&rsquo;s original plan was to give &ldquo;Romeo and
Juliet&rdquo; a happy ending, its first since the time of
Shakespeare. Juliet was to be awakened in time to
prevent Romeo&rsquo;s suicide, and the ballet would end
with a dance of jubilation by the reunited lovers.
Criticism was widespread and sharp when this modification
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s drama was exhibited at a trial
showing. All thought of a happy ending was promptly
abandoned, and Prokofieff put the tragic seal of death
on the finale of his ballet.</p>
<h2 id="c6">CHILDREN&rsquo;S CORNER</h2>
<h3 class="generic"><i>&ldquo;Peter and the Wolf,&rdquo; An Orchestral Fairy Tale for Children, Opus 67</i></h3>
<p>As early in his career as 1914 Prokofieff made his
first venture in the enchanted world of children&rsquo;s entertainment.
This was a cycle for voice and piano (or
orchestra) grouped under the general title of &ldquo;The
Ugly Duckling,&rdquo; after Andersen&rsquo;s fairy-tale. It was not
till twenty-two years later that he returned to this vein
and achieved a masterpiece for the young of all ages,
all times, and all countries, the so-called &ldquo;orchestral
fairy tale for children&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Peter and the Wolf&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Completed in Moscow on April 24, 1936, the score
was performed for the first time anywhere at a children&rsquo;s
concert of the Moscow Philharmonic the following
month. Two years later, on March 25, 1938,
the Boston Symphony Orchestra gave the music its
first performance outside of Russia. On January 13,
1940, the work was produced by the Ballet Theatre at
the Center Theatre, New York, with choreography
by Adolph Bolm, and Eugene Loring starring in the
role of Peter. Its success as a ballet was long and emphatic,
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
particularly with the younger matinee element.
Prominent in the general effectiveness of Prokofieff&rsquo;s
work is the role of the Narrator, for whom Prokofieff
supplied a simple and deliciously child-like text, with
flashes of delicate humor, very much in the animal
story tradition of Grimm and Andersen.</p>
<p>By way of introduction, Prokofieff has himself identified
the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; of his &ldquo;orchestral fairy tale&rdquo; on
the first page of the score:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each character of this Tale is represented by a
corresponding instrument in the orchestra: the bird
by the flute, the duck by an oboe, the cat by a clarinet
in the low register, the grandfather by a bassoon, the
wolf by three horns, Peter by the string quartet, the
shooting of the hunters by the kettle-drums and the
bass drum. Before an orchestral performance it is desirable
to show these instruments to the children and
to play on them the corresponding leitmotives. Thereby
the children learn to distinguish the sonorities of
the instruments during the performance of this Tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The characters having been duly tagged and labelled,
the Narrator, in a tone that is by turns casual,
confiding and awesome, begins to tell of the adventures
of Peter....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early one morning Peter opened the gate and
went out into the big green meadow. On a branch of
a big tree sat a little Bird, Peter&rsquo;s friend. &lsquo;All is quiet,&rsquo;
chirped the Bird gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just then a Duck came waddling round. She was
glad that Peter had not closed the gate, and decided
to take a nice swim in the deep pond in the meadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing the Duck, the little Bird flew down upon
the grass, settled next to her, and shrugged his shoulders:
&lsquo;What kind of a bird are you, if you can&rsquo;t fly?&rsquo;
said he. To this the Duck replied: &lsquo;What kind of a
bird are you, if you can&rsquo;t swim?&rsquo; and dived into the
pond. They argued and argued, the Duck swimming
in the pond, the little Bird hopping along the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly, something caught Peter&rsquo;s attention. He
noticed a Cat crawling through the grass. The Cat
thought: &lsquo;The Bird is busy arguing, I will just grab
him.&rsquo; Stealthily she crept toward him on her velvet
paws. &lsquo;Look out!&rsquo; shouted Peter, and the Bird immediately
flew up into the tree while the Duck quacked
angrily at the Cat from the middle of the pond. The
Cat walked around the tree and thought: &lsquo;Is it worth
climbing up so high? By the time I get there the Bird
will have flown away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather came out. He was angry because
Peter had gone into the meadow. &lsquo;It is a dangerous
place. If a Wolf should come out of the forest, then
what would you do?&rsquo; Peter paid no attention to
Grandfather&rsquo;s words. Boys like him are not afraid of
Wolves, but Grandfather took Peter by the hand,
locked the gate, and led him home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sooner had Peter gone than a big gray Wolf
came out of the forest. In a twinkling the Cat climbed
up the tree. The Duck quacked, and in her excitement
jumped out of the pond. But no matter how hard the
Duck tried to run, she couldn&rsquo;t escape the Wolf. He
was getting nearer ... nearer ... catching up with
her ... and then he got her and, with one gulp, swallowed
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, this is how things stand: the Cat was
sitting on one branch, the Bird on another&mdash;not too
close to the Cat&mdash;and the Wolf walked round and
round the tree looking at them with greedy eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, Peter, without the slightest fear,
stood behind the closed gate watching all that was
going on. He ran home, got a strong rope, and climbed
up the high stone wall. One of the branches of the
tree, round which the Wolf was walking, stretched
out over the wall. Grabbing hold of the branch, Peter
lightly climbed over onto the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter said to the Bird: &lsquo;Fly down and circle round
the Wolf&rsquo;s head; only take care that he doesn&rsquo;t catch
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
you.&rsquo; The Bird almost touched the Wolf&rsquo;s head with
his wings while the Wolf snapped angrily at him from
this side and that. How the Bird did worry the wolf!
How he wanted to catch him! But the Bird was cleverer,
and the Wolf simply couldn&rsquo;t do anything about
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, Peter made a lasso and, carefully letting
it down, caught the Wolf by the tail and pulled
with all his might. Feeling himself caught, the Wolf
began to jump wildly, trying to get loose. But Peter
tied the other end of the rope to the tree, and the
Wolf&rsquo;s jumping only made the rope around his tail
tighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just then, the hunters came out of the woods following
the Wolf&rsquo;s trail and shooting as they went. But
Peter, sitting in the tree, said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot! Birdie and
I have caught the Wolf. Now help us to take him to
the zoo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there ... imagine the procession: Peter at
the head; after him the hunters leading the Wolf; and
winding up the procession, Grandfather and the Cat.
Grandfather tossed his head discontentedly! &lsquo;Well,
and if Peter hadn&rsquo;t caught the Wolf? What then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above them flew Birdie chirping merrily: &lsquo;My,
what brave fellows we are, Peter and I! Look what we
have caught!&rsquo; And if one would listen very carefully he
could hear the Duck quacking inside the Wolf; because
the Wolf in his hurry had swallowed her alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Prokofieff&rsquo;s biographer Nestyev &ldquo;Peter and the
Wolf&rdquo; represents a &ldquo;gallery of clever and amusing
animal portraits as vividly depicted as though painted
from nature by an animal artist.&rdquo; Certainly, this ingenious
assortment of chirping and purring and clucking
and howling, translated into terms of a masterly
orchestral speech, is the tender and loving work of a
story-teller patient and tolerant of the claims of children,
and awed by their infinite imaginative capacity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h3 class="generic"><i>&ldquo;Summer Day,&rdquo; Children&rsquo;s Suite for Little Symphony, Opus 65-B</i></h3>
<p>Five years after completing &ldquo;Peter and the Wolf&rdquo;
Prokofieff returned once again to the children&rsquo;s corner.
This time it was a suite for little symphony called
&ldquo;Summer Day.&rdquo; Actually the suite had begun as a
series of piano pieces, entitled &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Music,&rdquo;
that Prokofieff had written and published shortly before
he turned his thoughts to &ldquo;Peter and the Wolf.&rdquo;
The chances are that it was this very &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s
Music&rdquo; that precipitated him into the child&rsquo;s world of
wonder and fantasy from which were to emerge Peter&rsquo;s
adventures in the animal kingdom. It was not till
1941, however, that he assembled an assortment of
these piano pieces and arranged them for orchestra.
Credit for their first performance in America belongs
to the New York Philharmonic-Symphony, which included
them on its program of October 25, 1945.
Artur Rodzinski conducted. At that time Robert Bagar
and I were the society&rsquo;s program annotators, and the
analysis given below was written by him for our program-book
of that date.</p>
<p>I. &ldquo;<i>Morning</i>&rdquo; (<i>Andante tranquillo, C major, 4-4</i>).
An odd little phrase is played by the first flute with
occasional reinforcement from the second, while the
other woodwinds engage in a mild counterpoint and
the strings and bass drum supply the rhythmic anchorage.
In a middle part the bassoons, horns, &rsquo;cellos and
(later) the violas and bass sing a rather serious melody,
as violins and flutes offer accompanying figures.</p>
<p>II. &ldquo;<i>Tag</i>&rdquo; (<i>Vivo, F major, 6-8</i>). A bright, tripping
melody begins in the violins and flutes and is soon
shared by bassoons. It is repeated, this time leading
to the key of E-flat where the oboes play it in a modified
form. There follows a short intermediary passage
in the same tripping spirit, although the rhythm is
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
stressed more. After some additional modulations the
section ends with the opening strain.</p>
<p>III. &ldquo;<i>Waltz</i>&rdquo; (<i>Allegretto, A major, 3-4</i>). A tart and
tangy waltz theme, introduced by the violins, has an
unusual &ldquo;feel&rdquo; about it because of the unexpected intervals
in the melody. In a more subdued manner the
violins usher in a second theme, which, however, is
given a Prokofieffian touch by the interspersed woodwind
chords in octave skips. As before, the opening
idea serves as the section&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>IV. &ldquo;<i>Regrets</i>&rdquo; (<i>Moderato, F major, 4-4</i>). An expressive,
straightforward melody starts in the &rsquo;cellos.
Oboes pick it up in a slightly revised form and they
and the first violins conclude it. Next the violins and
clarinets give it a simple variation. In the meantime,
there are some subsidiary figures in the other instruments.
All ends in just the slightest kind of finale.</p>
<p>V. &ldquo;<i>March</i>&rdquo; (<i>Tempo di marcia, C major, 4-4</i>).
Clarinets and oboes each take half of the chief melody.
The horns then play it and, following a brief middle
sequence with unusual leaps, the tune ends in a harmonic
combination of flutes, oboes, horns and trumpets.</p>
<p>VI. &ldquo;<i>Evening</i>&rdquo; (<i>Andante teneroso, F major, 3-8</i>).
Prokofieff&rsquo;s knack of making unusual melodic intervals
sound perfectly natural is here well illustrated.
A solo flute intones the opening bars of a pleasant
song-like tune, the rest of which is given to the solo
clarinet. Still in the same reflective mood, the music
continues with a passage of orchestral arpeggios, while
the first violins take their turn with the melody. A
middle portion in A-flat major presents some measures
of syncopation. With a change of key to C major and
again to F major, the section ends tranquilly with a
snatch of the opening tune.</p>
<p>VII. &ldquo;<i>Moonlit Meadows</i>&rdquo; (<i>Andantino, D major,
2-4</i>). The solo flute opens this section with a smooth-flowing
melody which rather makes the rounds, though
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
in more or less altered form. The section ends quite
simply with three chords.</p>
<p>This transcription departs but slightly from the
piano originals, and when it does so it is because the
composer has obviously felt the need of a stronger
accent here or some figure there, unimportant in
themselves, which might serve to bolster up the Suite.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><i>March from the Opera, &ldquo;The Love of Three Oranges&rdquo;, Opus 33-A</i></h3>
<p>It was Cleofonte Campanini, leading conductor of
the Chicago Opera Company, who approached Prokofieff
early in 1919 for an opera. Prokofieff first offered
&ldquo;The Gambler&rdquo;, of which he possessed only the piano
part, having left the orchestral score behind in the
library of the Maryinsky Theatre of Leningrad. The
offer was put aside for a second proposal&mdash;a project
Prokofieff had already been toying with in Russia.
This was an opera inspired in part by a device prominent
in the Italian tradition of Commedia dell&rsquo;Arte
and based, as a story, on an Italian classic. The idea
excited Campanini, and a contract was speedily signed.
The piano score was completed by the following June,
and in October the orchestral score was ready for submission.
Preparations were made for a production in
Chicago, when Campanini suddenly died. An entire
season went by before its world premiere was finally
achieved under the directorship of Mary Garden. This
occurred on December 30, 1921, at the Chicago Auditorium,
with Prokofieff conducting and Nina Koshetz
making her American debut as the Fata Morgana. A
French version was used, prepared by Prokofieff and
Vera Janacoupolos from the original Russian text of
the composer. Press and public were friendly, if not
over-enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Less than two months later, on February 14, 1922,
the Chicago Opera Company presented the opera for
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
the first time in New York, at the Manhattan Opera
House, with Prokofieff himself again conducting. This
time the critics were far from friendly. One of them
remarked waspishly: &ldquo;The cost of the production is
$130,000, which is $43,000 for each orange. The
opera fell so flat that its repetition would spell financial
ruin.&rdquo; There were no further performances that
season. Indeed it was not till November 1, 1949, that
&ldquo;The Love of Three Oranges&rdquo; returned to American
currency. It was on that night that Laszlo Halasz introduced
the work into the repertory of the New York
City Opera Company at the City Center of Music and
Drama. The opera was presented in a skilful English
version made by Victor Seroff. The production was
&ldquo;an almost startling success,&rdquo; in the words of Olin
Downes. &ldquo;The opera became overnight the talk of
the town and took a permanent place in the repertory
of the company. This was due in large part to the
character of the production itself, which so well became
the fantasy and satire of the libretto, and the
dynamic power of Prokofieff&rsquo;s score. An additional
factor in the success was, without doubt, the development
of taste and receptivity to modern music on the
part of the public which had taken place in the intervening
odd quarter of a century since the opera first
saw the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prokofieff based his libretto on Carlo Gossi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fiaba
dell&rsquo;amore delle tre melarancie&rdquo; (The Tale of the Love
of the Three Oranges). Gozzi, an eighteenth-century
dramatist and story-teller, had a genius for giving fresh
form to old tales and legends and for devising new
ones. The tales were called <i>fiabe</i>, or fables. Later
dramatists found them a fertile source of suggestions
for plot, and opera composers have been no less
indebted to this gifted teller of tales. Puccini&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Turandot&rdquo; is only one of at least six operas founded
on Gozzi&rsquo;s masterly little <i>fiaba</i> of legendary China.
The vein of satire running through Gozzi&rsquo;s <i>fiabe</i> has
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
also attracted subsequent writers and composers. It
is not surprising that Prokofieff, no mean satirist himself,
found inspiration for an opera in one of these
delicious <i>fiabe</i>.</p>
<p>In view of the great popularity which &ldquo;The Love
of Three Oranges&rdquo; has won in recent seasons in
America, it may be of some practical use and interest
to the readers of this monograph to provide them
with an outline of the plot. I originally wrote the
synopsis that follows for &ldquo;The Victor Book of Operas&rdquo;
in the 1949 issue revised and edited for Simon &amp;
Schuster by myself and Robert Bagar. &ldquo;The Love of
Three Oranges&rdquo; is divided into a Prologue and Four
Acts.</p>
<p class="center">PROLOGUE</p>
<p>SCENE: <i>Stage, with Lowered Curtain and Grand
Proscenium, on Each Side of Which are Little Balconies
and Balustrades.</i> An artistic discussion is under
way among four sets of personages on which kind of
play should be enacted on the present occasion. The
Glooms, clad in appropriately somber roles, argue
for tragedy. The Joys, in costumes befitting their temperament,
hold out for romantic comedy. The Empty-heads
disagree with both and call for frank farce. At
last, the Jesters (also called the Cynics) enter, and
succeed in silencing the squabbling groups. Presently
a Herald enters to announce that the King of Clubs
is grieving because his son never smiles. The various
personages now take refuge in balconies at the sides
of the stage, and from there make comments on the
play that is enacted. But for their lack of poise and
dignity, they would remind one of the chorus in
Greek drama.</p>
<p class="center">ACT I</p>
<p>SCENE: <i>The King&rsquo;s Palace.</i> The King of Clubs,
in despair over his son&rsquo;s hopeless defection, has summoned
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
physicians to diagnose the ailment. After
elaborate consultation, the doctors inform the King
that to be cured the Prince must learn to laugh. The
Prince, alas, like most hypochondriacs, has no sense
of humor. The King resolves to try the prescribed
remedy. Truffaldino, one of the comic figures, is now
assigned the task of preparing a gay festival and
masquerade to bring cheer into the Prince&rsquo;s smileless
life. All signify approval of the plan except the Prime
Minister Leander, who is plotting with the King&rsquo;s
niece Clarisse to seize the throne after slaying the
Prince. In a sudden evocation of fire and smoke, the
wicked witch, Fata Morgana, appears, followed by
a swarm of little devils. As a fiendish game of cards
ensues between the witch, who is aiding Leander&rsquo;s
plot, and Tchelio, the court magician, attendant
demons burst into a wild dance. The Fata Morgana
wins and, with a peal of diabolical laughter, vanishes.
The jester vainly tries to make the lugubrious Prince
laugh, and as festival music comes from afar, the two
go off in that direction.</p>
<p class="center">ACT II</p>
<p>SCENE: <i>The Main Courtroom of the Royal Palace.</i>
In the grand court of the palace, merrymakers are
busy trying to make the Prince laugh, but their efforts
are unavailing for two reasons: the Prince&rsquo;s nature
is adamant to gaiety and the evil Fata Morgana is
among them, spoiling the fun. Recognizing her,
guards seize the sorceress and attempt to eject her.
In the struggle that ensues she turns an awkward
somersault, a sight so ridiculous that even the Prince
is forced to laugh out loud. All rejoice, for the Prince,
at long last, is cured! In revenge, the Fata Morgana
now pronounces a dire curse on the recovered Prince:
he shall again be miserable until he has won the &ldquo;love
of the three oranges.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">ACT III</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>SCENE: <i>A Desert.</i> In the desert the magician
Tchelio meets the Prince and pronounces an incantation
against the cook who guards the three oranges
in the near-by castle. As the Prince and his companion,
the jester Truffaldino, head for the castle, the orchestra
plays a scherzo, fascinating in its ingeniously woven
web of fantasy. Arriving at the castle, the Prince and
Truffaldino obtain the coveted oranges after overcoming
many hazards. Fatigued, the Prince now goes
to sleep. A few moments later Truffaldino is seized
by thirst and, as he cuts open one of the oranges, a
beautiful Princess steps out, begging for water. Since
it is decreed that the oranges must be opened at the
water&rsquo;s edge, the helpless Princess promptly dies of
thirst. Startled, Truffaldino at length works up courage
enough to open a second orange, and, lo! another
Princess steps out, only to meet the same fate. Truffaldino
rushes out. The spectators in the balconies at
the sides of the stage argue excitedly over the fate of
the Princess in the third orange. When the Prince
awakens, he takes the third orange and cautiously
proceeds to open it. The Princess Ninette emerges this
time, begs for water, and is about to succumb to a
deadly thirst, when the Jesters rush to her rescue with
a bucket of water.</p>
<p class="center">ACT IV</p>
<p>SCENE: <i>The Throne Room of the Royal Palace.</i>
The Prince and the Princess Ninette are forced to
endure many more trials through the evil power of
the Fata Morgana. At one juncture the Princess is
even changed into a mouse. The couple finally overcome
all the hardships the witch has devised, and in
the end are happily married. Thus foiled in her
wicked sorcery, the Fata Morgana is captured and

led away, leaving traitorous Leander and Clarisse to
face the King&rsquo;s ire without the aid of her magic
powers.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Typical in this &ldquo;burlesque opera&rdquo; is Prokofieff&rsquo;s
penchant for witty, sardonic writing. This cleverly
evoked world of satiric sorcery is perhaps far removed
from Prokofieff&rsquo;s main areas of operatic interest,
which were Russian history and literature. The pungent
note of modernism is readily heard in this music,
though compared with the more dissonant writing of
Prokofieff&rsquo;s piano and violin concertos, it is a kind
of modified modernism, diverting in its sophisticated
discourse on the child&rsquo;s world of fairyland wonder.
If, as Nestyev says, the work is &ldquo;a subtle parody of
the old romantic opera with its false pathos and sham
fantasy,&rdquo; it is primarily what it purports to be&mdash;a
fairy tale, as gay and sparkling and wondrous as any
in the whole realm of opera.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>The brilliant and bizarre &ldquo;March&rdquo; from this opera
has become one of the best known and most widely
exploited symphonic themes of our time. It comes as
an exhilarating orchestral interlude in the first act at
the point where the straight-faced Prince and his
Jester wander off in the direction of the festival music.
The &ldquo;March&rdquo; is built around a swaying theme of
irresistible appeal that mounts in power as it is repeated
and comes to a sudden and forceful halt, as
if at the crack of a whip.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
